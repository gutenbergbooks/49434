<a name="PREFACE"></a><h2>PREFACE.
</h2>
<p>We consider the Bible, Book of Mormon, Book of Doctrine and Covenants,
Pearl of Great Price and sayings of Joseph, the Seer, our guides in
faith and doctrine. The first four have been adopted as such by a vote
of the Saints in General Conference. Reference to other writings are
only for illustration of the subject.
</p>
<p>We have sought to furnish the best available material for the use of
the Elders. It is for them to seek for the wisdom of the Holy Spirit to
enable them to use it with discretion.
</p>
<p>On most of the subjects treated, only a portion of the passages that
refer to them have been cited, but we have endeavored to use the best.
We designed to make the Compendium sufficiently elaborate to give it a
wide range of usefulness, and, at the same time, not make it so large
as to be burdensome to the Elders who travel and preach the Gospel.
Practically, we have aimed to get up a book that would contain a great
amount of information for its bulk.
</p>
<p>The arguments on each subject are so plain and direct, that, we trust,
they may be made available by the most inexperienced Elders. At the
same time, the references and citations are considered sufficient
for the more advanced student to acquire a thorough knowledge of the
subjects treated on.
</p>
<p>The references in small type are not designed to be verbatim, but
only to embody, as near as may be, the leading idea of the passage
referred lo. They should be studied before being used. The passages
included within the usual quotation marks, thus, " ", are designed to
be correctly quoted, and may be used without referring to the original.
</p>
<p>We are indebted to Elder George Reynolds for the carefully prepared
Chronology of the Book of Mormon. It is evidently the result of much
study and thought, and as such is entitled to credence.
</p>
<p>While we have aimed at accuracy, we should be pleased to have our
friends inform us of any material error they may discover.
</p>
<p>We expect our labors will elicit some criticism, but we trust the
thoughtful and experienced will allow much for the complicated
character of the work.

<h2>A COMPENDIUM OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE GOSPEL.
</h2>


<a name="Articles"></a><h3>ARTICLES OF FAITH.
</h3>
<p>1. We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ,
and in the Holy Ghost.
</p>
<p>2. We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for
Adam's transgression.
</p>
<p>3. We believe that, through the atonement of Christ, all mankind may be
saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.
</p>
<p>4. We believe that these ordinances are: First, Faith in the Lord
Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the
remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the Gift of the Holy
Ghost.
</p>
<p>5. We believe that a man must be called of God, by "prophecy, and by
the laying on of hands," by those who are in authority, to preach the
Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.
</p>
<p>6. We believe in the same organization that existed in the primitive
church, viz: apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc.
</p>
<p>7. We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions,
healing, interpretation of tongues, etc.
</p>
<p>8. We believe the Bible to be the word of God, as far as it is
translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word
of God.
</p>
<p>9. We believe all that God has revealed, all that he does now reveal,
and we believe that he will yet reveal many great and important things
pertaining to the Kingdom of God.
</p>
<p>10. We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the
restoration of the ten tribes. That Zion will be built upon this
continent. That Christ will reign personally upon the earth, and that
the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisic glory.
</p>
<p>11. We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the
dictates of our conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let
them worship how, where, or what they may.
</p>
<p>12. We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers and
magistrates, in obeying, honoring and sustaining the law.
</p>
<p>13. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous,
and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the
admonition of Paul, "We believe all things, we hope all things;" we
have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If
there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report, or praiseworthy,
we seek after these things.&mdash;JOSEPH SMITH.
</p>


<a name="Fall"></a><h2>THE FALL OF ADAM.
</h2>
<p>"Honor thy Father and thy Mother." This was one of the ten special
commandments given to Israel, during a grand display of God's power and
glory on Mount Sinai.
</p>
<p>In the past centuries of darkness it appears to have lost its
significance with the Christian world. They do not appear to realize
that honor is due to the first parents of the human race. They have
been long taught that Adam and Eve were great transgressors, and have
mourned over the fact that they partook of the forbidden fruit and
brought death into the world.
</p>
<p>There is no possibility that the fall of man was an accident or chance,
any more than was his creation. If an accident, then why was Christ
prepared from before the foundation of the world as a propitiation for
sin, and to open up the way for man to immortality?
</p>
<p>Christ's mediation was a sequence of the fall. "Him hath God exalted
with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance
to Israel, and forgiveness of sins;" Acts 5. 31. Without the fall
there would have been no broken law, and therefore nothing to repent
of; and there could be no forgiveness of sin without the atonement of
Christ.
</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon makes this subject very plain: "And now, behold,
if Adam had not transgressed, he would not have fallen; but he would
have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created,
must have remained in the same state which they were, after they were
created; and they must have remained for ever, and had no end. And they
would have had no children; wherefore they would have remained in a
state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no
good, for they knew no sin;" 2 Nephi 2. 22, 23.
</p>
<p>It is evident, not only from this passage, but from all that is
recorded on this subject, that, if Adam and Eve had not attained to a
knowledge of evil, by partaking of the forbidden fruit, the human race
could not have existed under present conditions. It is also evident,
that without a knowledge of both good and evil, man would be incapable
of exercising a free agency, and therefore not capable of independent,
self-reliant action&mdash;a necessary condition for development and progress.
</p>
<p>We, the children of Adam, have no right to bring accusations against
the Patriarch of the race. But father, we should rejoice with them,
that through their fall and the atonement of Jesus Christ, the way
of eternal life has been opened up to us. It was after an angel had
administered to Adam, and made known to him the atonement through the
Only Begotten Son of the Father, that he and Eve gave expression to
their joy, in view of the glorious future of the race.
</p>
<p>"And in that day Adam blessed God and was filled, and began to prophesy
concerning all the families of the earth, saying, Blessed be the name
of God, for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this
life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God. And Eve,
his wife, heard all these things and was glad, saying, Were it not for
our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have
known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal
life which God giveth unto all the obedient;" Pearl of Great Price,
page 10.
</p>
<p>The principle of obedience could only be developed in man through the
fall, and only through that can they realize the joys of redemption
and eternal life. The woman fell first, and led Adam out of Eden and
the presence of the Lord. "Adam was not deceived, but the woman being
deceived was in transgression;" 1 <em>Tim</em>. 2. 14.
</p>
<p>When the Lord asked Adam if he had eaten of the fruit of the tree, of
which he had commanded him that he should not eat, he replied, "The
woman whom thou gavest <em>to be</em> with me, she gave me of the tree, and
I did eat;" <em>Gen</em>. iii, 12. Adam had been previously commanded to
multiply and replenish the earth, and he could not do so unless he
remained with Eve. She, being deceived, forced upon him the necessity
of partaking of the forbidden fruit with her, or of remaining in a
condition where it would have been impossible to fulfil the first great
commandment of the Father.

<a name="Agency"></a><h2>FREE AGENCY OF MAN.
</h2>
<p>The doctrine of free agency is plainly elucidated in the written
revelations from God. The plan for man's redemption was predicated on
his fall.
</p>
<p>No law could have been given to our first parents, and no penalty
affixed for the breaking of a law, unless they had been free to act
without constraint. The liberty to choose was given by the Creator to
the progenitors of the race, and that liberty has been fully recognized
in all his dealings with their posterity.
</p>
<p>As the Patriarch of the race entailed on it an experimental knowledge
of good and evil, through sufferings and death, so, through the
sufferings and death of the Only Begotten Son, they are redeemed from
the effects of his transgression, independent of any act of theirs.
</p>
<p>Man was created in the image of God, with the possibility of becoming
like him. But he cannot attain to that position without a knowledge of
good and evil. Through the act of the Father he has attained to that
knowledge; through the act of the Son he is delivered from the effects
of original transgression.
</p>
<p>Thus, with the privilege of exercising his free agency, he is placed on
an equality with the parents of the race, and has the choice of good or
evil for himself, with the results of that choice. If he chooses evil,
a second death will be the result. If the good, it will prove to be the
way to all the powers, glories and exaltations that the Gods enjoy, in
whose image man is created.
</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon is very plain on this subject: "Wherefore, men are
free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are
expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal
life, through the great mediation of all men, or to choose captivity
and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil;" 2 <em>Nephi</em>
2. 27.

<a name="Atonement"></a><h2>THE ATONEMENT.
</h2>
<p>The word atonement signifies deliverance, through the offering of a
ransom, from the penalty of a broken law. The sense is expressed in
<em>Job</em> 33. 24: "Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a
ransom."
</p>
<p>As effected by Jesus Christ, it signifies the deliverance, through
his death and resurrection, of the earth and everything pertaining
to it, from the power which death has obtained over them through the
transgression of Adam.
</p>
<p>The following passage is very comprehensive on the atonement of Christ:
"And the end shall come, and the heaven and the earth shall be consumed
and pass away, and there shall be a new heaven and a new earth, for all
old things shall pass away, and all things shall become new, even the
heaven and the earth, and all the fulness thereof, both men and beasts,
the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea; and not one hair,
neither mote, shall be lost, for it is the workmanship of mine hand;"
<em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 29. 23-25. In the revelations of St. John we read, "And
he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new;" 21. 5.
</p>
<p>The righteous could not inherit all things in their immortal, exalted
condition, if all things were not resurrected to immortality as well as
themselves.
</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul quite comprehensively sums up the results of Christ's
death and resurrection: "But now is Christ risen from the dead, and
become the first fruits of them that slept. For since by man <em>came</em>
death, by man <em>came</em> also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam
all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive;" I <em>Cor</em>. 15. 21,
22. That is, death having come on all men through the disobedience of
Adam, so must all be raised to immortality and eternal life through the
death and resurrection of Christ.
</p>
<p>Paul also asserted that "the last enemy <em>that</em> shall be destroyed <em>is</em>
death;" <em>Verse</em> 26. John the Revelator declares that he saw death and
hell cast into the lake of fire; <em>Rev</em>. 20. 14.
</p>
<p>The atonement, as wrought out by Jesus Christ, further signifies that
he has opened up the way for man's redemption from his own sins,
through faith in Christ's sufferings, death and resurrection. The
Apostle Paul well expresses this, "For all have sinned, and come short
of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace through the
redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth <em>to be</em> a
propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness
for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of
God; to declare, <em>I say</em>, at this time his righteousness: that he might
be just, and the Justifier of him which believeth in Jesus;" <em>Rom</em>. 3.
23-26.
</p>
<p>These passages evidence that redemption from death, through the
sufferings of Christ, is for all men, both the righteous and the
wicked; for this earth, and for all things created upon it. The
whole tenor of the Scriptures assure us, that while they may be sure
of resurrection from death, regardless of their personal acts, yet
they will be rewarded for their works, whether they be good or evil,
and that redemption from personal sins can only be obtained through
obedience to the requirements of the Gospel, and a life of good works.
</p>
<p>The transgression of Adam being infinite in its consequences, those
consequences cannot be averted, except through an infinite atonement.
The Prophet Nephi makes this very plain: "Wherefore it must needs be
an infinite atonement; save it should be an infinite atonement, this
corruption could not put on incorruption. Wherefore, the first judgment
which came upon man, must needs have remained to an endless duration.
And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to
its mother earth, to rise no more. O the wisdom of God! his mercy and
grace! For behold, if the flesh should rise no more, our spirits must
become subject to that angel who fell from before the presence of the
eternal God, and became the devil, to rise no more.
</p>
<p>O how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our escape
from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, death and
hell, which I call the death of the body, and also the death of the
spirit;" 2. <em>Nephi</em> 7, 8, 10. "There is one thing, however, which the
atonement does for us, immediately upon our entrance into this mortal
life; it sets us free from the first spiritual death."
</p>
<p>"As in Adam all died spiritually, even so in Christ all, in their
infancy, are made alive spiritually. Christ, by the atonement, became
the life and the light of men; he is the true light by which all are
lighted who come into the world. Without this light all would have
suffered in the eternal night of darkness, from which there would
have been no return. But little children, by the atonement, are made
alive, and are all subjects of salvation, being redeemed by the blood
of Christ from the fall, being pure, and spotless, and innocent, and
thus are made heirs of the kingdom of heaven. This redemption from the
spiritual death upon all mankind in their infant state, is brought
about without any conditions on the part of the creature; it is wrought
out by the free grace of Christ alone, without works;" <em>O. Pratt</em>.
</p>
<p>"I say unto you, that little children are redeemed from the foundation
of the world through mine Only Begotten: wherefore, they cannot sin,
for power is not given unto Satan to tempt little children, until they
begin to become accountable before me;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 29. 46, 47.
</p>
<p>"Wherefore, it came to pass that the devil tempted Adam, and he partook
the forbidden fruit and transgressed the commandment, wherein he became
subject to the will of the devil, because he yielded unto temptation.
Wherefore I the Lord God caused that he should be cast out from the
Garden of Eden, from my presence, because of his transgression, wherein
he became spiritually dead, which is the first death, even that same
death, which is the last death, which is spiritual, which shall be
pronounced upon the wicked when I shall say&mdash;Depart, ye cursed. But,
behold, I say unto you, that I the Lord God gave unto Adam and unto his
seed that they should not die as to the temporal death, until I the
Lord God should send forth angels to declare unto them repentance and
redemption, through faith on the name of mine Only Begotten Son. And
thus did I, the Lord God, appoint unto man the days of his probation
that by his natural death he might be raised in immortality unto
eternal life, even as many as would believe; and they that believe
not unto eternal damnation, for they cannot be redeemed from their
spiritual fall, because they repent not; for they will love darkness
rather than light, and their deeds are evil, and they receive their
wages of whom they list to obey;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 29. 40-45.

<a name="FAITH"></a><h2>FAITH.
</h2>
<p>"Faith is the first principle of revealed religion and the foundation
of all righteousness." "Now faith is the substance (assurance) of
things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen;" <em>Heb</em>. 11. 1, <em>Doc.
and Cov., Lecture on Faith</em>, 1. 1-8. That to use the word assurance,
instead of substance, would be the proper rendering of the above
passage, is evident from the 22d verse of the previous chapter: "Let us
draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith."
</p>
<p>Faith begets trust and confidence. "In whom we have boldness and access
with <em>confidence</em> by the faith of him;" (Jesus Christ.) <em>Eph</em>. 3.
12. Faith is the gift of God. "Saved through faith; and that not of
yourselves: <em>it is</em> the gift of God;" 2. 8. "To another faith by the
same Spirit;" 1 <em>Cor</em>. 12. 9. "But to think soberly, according as God
hath dealt to every man the measure of faith;" <em>Rom</em>. 12. 3. <em>Moroni</em>
10. 11.
</p>
<p>Through repentance, baptism and the laying on of hands man may receive
the Holy Ghost. It will open his spiritual vision and he will begin to
comprehend himself, the object of his creation, and his affinity to
his Heavenly Father. Then through the further observance of all the
ordinances of the Gospel, will the righteousness of God be revealed to
him, from faith to faith, until by keeping the commandments and seeking
after knowledge through the inspirations of the Holy Ghost, in time, he
will reach that assurance of faith which is unto eternal life.
</p>
<p>The <em>Lectures on Faith</em>, by Joseph Smith, Jun., in <em>Doc. and Cov</em>.,
may justly be considered the most elaborate treatise on the subject
in the sacred writings. They are written in such simplicity, that
they can be easily understood by all who will honestly study them,
to obtain a knowledge of the nature of faith. Their fulness, their
comprehensiveness, is one of the many evidences of the Divine
inspiration of the Prophet Joseph.
</p>
<p>The first lecture shows that faith is an assurance that men have of the
existence of things that they have not seen, and that it is an element
of power. "It is the principle by which Jehovah works, and through
which he exercises power over all temporal as well as eternal things."
</p>
<p>The second lecture informs us how faith, in the beginning was based
on a knowledge of God and his attributes, and that faith in God has
existed in man in proportion to that knowledge.
</p>
<p>The third lecture teaches us that to exercise faith in God, man must
have an idea that he exists, and also of his character and attributes.
He must, as well, feel an assurance that he is living in accordance
with the will of God. Consequently, those who fail to obtain this
knowledge by living in the spirit and power of the Gospel, cannot
exercise a true and understanding faith in God, no matter what their
pretentions.
</p>
<p>Lecture fourth treats of the connection between correct ideas of God's
attributes, of his Knowledge, Faith or Power, Justice, Judgment, Mercy
and Truth; and the exercise of faith unto salvation, in a rational
being.
</p>
<p>The fifth lecture shows the necessity of faith in God the Father, and
in his Son Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p>Lecture sixth evidences the necessity of men knowing that their course
of life is in accordance with the will of God, in order to exercise
faith in him unto salvation. "It was this that enabled the ancient
Saints to endure all their afflictions and persecutions, and to take
joyfully the spoiling of their goods, knowing (not believing merely)
that they had a more enduring substance. <em>Heb</em>. 10. 34.
</p>
<p>The seventh lecture treats of the effects of faith. That working
by faith is working by mental exertion instead of physical force;
illustrating the fact by numerous examples. It also elucidates the
principle that the mental powers are far superior to the physical
forces of nature, and that through them the power of faith is
manifested.

<a name="faithinpriesthood"></a><h2>NECESSITY OF FAITH IN THE HOLY PRIESTHOOD.
</h2>
<p>In every dispensation in which God has made known his will to man, it
has been done through a living, inspired Priesthood. Passages from the
sacred writings might be multiplied, indefinitely, on this subject. But
this is not necessary, inasmuch as all the sacred records attest the
necessity of an inspired Priesthood, and obedience to it on the part of
the people, if they would understand the will of the Lord concerning
them.
</p>
<p>Fifteen centuries of the history of Israel, from the Exodus to the
destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, is a record of adversity
through disobedience to seers and prophets, and of prosperity, the
result of listening to their teachings.
</p>
<p>Mankind, with a wide range of religious tenets, are instinctively
imbued with a sentiment of reverence and obedience to those who
minister in the ordinances of religion. After the apostacy of the early
apostolic church, it had a strong hold on the minds of the people
during the supremacy of the Romish church.
</p>
<p>We may consider that this doctrine began to lose its hold on the masses
of the people, professing Christianity, after the Reformation and the
splitting up of the Christian world into a great multiplicity of sects.
</p>
<p>With the introduction of the Gospel and the Holy Priesthood, through
Joseph Smith, Jun., the necessity of faith in a living Priesthood is
daily being made more apparent to the Latter-day Saints.

<a name="repentance"></a><h2>REPENTANCE.
</h2>
<p>The Nephite prophet, Alma, gives a very comprehensive idea of the
importance of repentance. "Yea, I would that ye would come forth and
harden not your hearts any longer; for behold, now is the time, and
the day of your salvation; and therefore, if ye will repent and harden
not your hearts, immediately shall the great plan of redemption be
brought about unto you. For behold, this life is the time for men to
prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for
men to perform their labors. And now as I said unto you before, as ye
have had so many witnesses, therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not
procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after this
day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we
do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of
darkness, wherein there can be no labor performed. Ye cannot say, when
ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will
return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which
doth possess your bodies at the time ye go out of this life, that same
spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.
For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance,
even until death, behold, ye have become subject to the spirit of the
devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath
withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all
power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked." <em>Alma</em> 34.
31-35.
</p>
<p>"For Godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented
of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death;" 2 <em>Cor</em>. 7. 10. Of the
sorrow that worketh death was that of Judas; <em>Matt</em>. 27. 3-5 In some
passages of the Scriptures repentance signifies a change of purpose
in man, as in the case of the son who refused to work in his father's
vineyard, but afterwards repented and went; 21. 28, 29.
</p>
<p>Again, it expresses the sympathy of the Lord for the sufferings of his
people: "For the Lord hearkened because of their groanings by reason
of them that oppressed them;" <em>Judges</em> 2. 18. It sometimes expresses
sympathy in man for the sufferings of others: "And the people repented
them for Benjamin, because that the Lord had made a breach in the
tribes of Israel;" 21. 15.
</p>
<p>In the history of the deliverance of Israel from Egypt, we are informed
that Pharaoh's heart was hardened, so that he would not let the people
go. We are evidently to understand by this, that on account of the
great wickedness of the Egyptians, the Lord did not soften their hearts
by the gentle influences of his Spirit, but permitted them to pursue
their own chosen way and suffer the consequences.
</p>
<p>We read in the Revelations of St. John: "And the rest of the men which
were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their
hands;" 9. 20. "And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains
and their sores, and repented not of their deeds;" 16. 11. These, like
the Egyptians, had passed the day of repentance, and were left to reap
the reward of their wickedness.
</p>
<p>On account of their former wickedness, it was all the converted
Lamanites could do to repent; <em>Alma</em> 24. 11.
</p>
<p>Repentance is a gift of God: "Then hath God also to the Gentiles
granted repentance unto life;" <em>Acts</em> 11. 18. "If God peradventure will
give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;" 2 <em>Tim</em>. 2.
25. "Not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth them to repentance;"
<em>Rom</em>. 2. 4. That is, the Lord grants to men of his Holy Spirit to
soften their hearts and enlighten their understandings, that they may
see and receive the truth, if they will; but his Spirit will not always
strive with man. Confession of sin, and restitution to the injured
party, was early made a standing law in Israel; <em>Num</em>. 5. 6, 7.
</p>
<p>Confession is one of the outward evidences of a godly sorrow for sin:
"For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the
mouth confession is made unto salvation;" <em>Rom</em>. 10. 10. "Confess
your faults one to another, and pray for one another, that ye may be
healed;" <em>James</em> 5. 16.
</p>
<p>On account of the magnitude of sins committed, repentance is not always
followed by forgiveness and restoration. For instance, when Peter was
preaching to the Jews, who had slain Jesus and taken his blood on
themselves and their children, he did not say, repent and be baptized
for the remission of sins; but "Repent ye therefore, and be converted,
that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall
come from the presence of the Lord; and (when) he shall send Jesus
Christ, which before was preached unto you: whom the heaven must
receive until the times of the restitution of all things;" <em>Acts</em> 3.
19-21. That is, repent now, and believe in Jesus Christ, that you may
be forgiven when he whom you have slain shall come again in the days of
the restitution of all things; and prescribe to you the terms on which
you may be saved.

<h2>BAPTISM.
</h2>
<a name="Necessity"></a><h3>NECESSITY OF BAPTISM.
</h3>
<p>That Gospel baptism is necessary to salvation, is abundantly evidenced
in the sacred writings. Christ, the highest authority known to man,
asserted this most emphatically when he said to Nicodemus, "Verily,
verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the
Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God;" <em>John</em> 3. 5.
</p>
<p>So important did the Savior consider baptism, that when he went to John
to be baptized, and John forbade him, he replied to him, "Suffer <em>it
to be so</em> now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness;"
<em>Matt</em>. 3. 13-15. In this he taught John the doctrine that a fulness of
righteousness or salvation, could not be received without it.
</p>
<p>The prophet Nephi, who lived nearly 600 years before the birth of our
Savior, clearly understood the necessity of baptism. Said he, "And now,
if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by
water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we,
being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water;" 2 <em>Nephi</em> 31. 5.
</p>
<p>The prophet Mormon, who lived nearly 1,000 years after Nephi, also
taught the necessity of following the example of our Savior in being
baptized, first, by water; <em>Mormon</em> 7. 10.
</p>
<p>In the opening up of the latter-day dispensation, the Lord said to his
prophet Joseph, "Whosoever believeth on my words them will I visit with
the manifestation of my Spirit, and they shall be born of me, even of
water and of the Spirit;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 5. 16.
</p>
<p>The Lord, in a revelation to Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon,
speaking of those who should be worthy to come forth in the
resurrection of the just, says, "They are they who received the
testimony of Jesus, and believed on his name and were baptized after
the manner of his burial, being buried in the water in his name;" 76.

</p>
<p>17. gives an account of the baptism of Adam.
</p>
<a name="Mode"></a><h3>MODE OF BAPTISM.
</h3>
<p>Not only is the necessity of baptism taught us by the highest possible
authority, but, as well, the manner in which that ordinance is to be
administered.
</p>
<p>Adam, the Father of the race, set an example for all his children to
follow. "And it came to pass, when the Lord had spoken with Adam, our
father, that Adam cried unto the Lord, and he was caught away by the
Spirit of the Lord, and was carried down into the water, and was laid
under the water, and was brought forth out of the water. And thus he
was baptized; and the Spirit of God descended upon him, and thus he was
born of the Spirit, and became quickened in the inner man;" <em>P. of G.
P</em>., p. 17.
</p>
<p>Christ went where John was baptizing in the river Jordan, to be
baptized of him, and "when he was baptized, went up straightway out
of the water;" <em>Matt</em>. 3. 16. That he was immersed, or buried in the
water, is evident from the sayings of the Apostle Paul, "Therefore we
are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was
raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also
should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together
in the likeness of his death, we shall be also <em>in the likeness of his
resurrection</em>;" Rom<em>. 6. 4, 5. "Buried with him in baptism, wherein
also ye are risen with </em>him<em> through the faith of the operation of
God;" Col</em>. 2. 12.
</p>
<p>The meaning of these passages is evident. If we would come forth in the
resurrection in the likeness of Christ, we must, like him, be buried
in the water, and come forth out of the water, in the likeness of his
burial and resurrection.
</p>
<p>The Nephites knew no other mode of Gospel baptism than immersion. Said
Jesus to his Nephite disciples, "And then shall ye immerse them in the
water, and come forth again out of the water;" 3 <em>Nephi</em> 11. 26.
</p>
<p>When our Savior sent forth his Jewish disciples to preach the Gospel,
he authorized them to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost; <em>Matt</em>. 28. 19. He instructed his Nephite disciples to
use the following words, "Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I
baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost. Amen;" 3 <em>Nephi</em> 11. 25.
</p>
<p>Quite explicit instructions on this subject are given to the Latter-day
Saints in the <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>.: "The person who is called of God, and has
authority from Jesus Christ to baptize, shall go down into the water
with the person who has presented him or herself for baptism, and shall
say, calling him or her by name&mdash;Having been commissioned of Jesus
Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost. Amen. Then shall he immerse him or her in the water,
and come forth again out of the water;" 20. 73, 74.
</p>
<p>Under date of May, 1829, we find the following account of the baptism
of J. Smith, Jun., and O. Cowdery, being the first baptisms in the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: "Accordingly we went and
were baptized, I baptized him first, and afterwards he baptized me,
after which I laid my hands upon his head and ordained him to the
Aaronic Priesthood, afterwards he laid his hands on me and ordained me
to the same Priesthood&mdash;for so were we commanded. * * * It was on the
fifteenth day of May, 1829, that we were ordained under the hand of
the Messenger, and baptized. Immediately on our coming up out of the
water, after we had been baptized, we experienced great and glorious
blessings."

</p>
<a name="Object"></a><h3>OBJECT OF BAPTISM.
</h3>
<p>The primary aim and end of baptism is the remission of sins. This
subject is fully explained by the Lord to our Father Adam. "Therefore
I give unto you a commandment, to teach these things freely unto your
children, saying, That by reason of transgression cometh the fall,
which fall bringeth death, and inasmuch as ye were born into the world
by water, and blood, and the spirit, which I have made, and so became
of dust a living soul, even so ye must be born again into the kingdom
of heaven, of water, and of the spirit, and be cleansed by blood, even
the blood of mine Only Begotten; that ye might be sanctified from all
sin, and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world, and eternal
life in the world to come, even immortal glory: For by the water ye
keep the commandment; by the spirit ye are justified, and by the blood
ye are sanctified; therefore it is given to abide in you; the record of
heaven; the Comforter; the peaceable things of immortal glory;" <em>P. of
G. P</em>., p. 16.
</p>
<p>The above quotation is full of meaning, but it is evident, at once,
that the object of baptism is to open the way through which, alone, men
may attain to all the blessings of salvation and eternal life. It was
especially the mission of John the Baptist to preach the baptism of
repentance for the remission of sins; <em>Mark</em> 1. 4.
</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost, the Apostle Peter very earnestly exhorted the
multitude, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of
Jesus Christ for the remission of sins;" <em>Acts</em> 2. 38.
</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul says, "Without shedding of blood is no remission;"
<em>Heb</em>. 9. 22. John the Apostle also asserts the same doctrine: "The
blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin;" 1 <em>John</em> 1.
7. It is evident, from the tenor of the sacred writings, that only by
being buried with Christ in water, by baptism, is the shedding of his
blood available to man for the remission of sins.

<a name="Dead"></a><h3>BAPTISM FOR THE DEAD
</h3>
<p>A prominent feature in the plan of redemption is the vicarious nature
of the labors of Christ, and his ministers, for the salvation of men.
In his death and resurrection, Christ did that for men which they could
not do for themselves. In all dispensations of the Priesthood, it has
been the duty of those officiating in its ordinances to act for others,
when they could not act for themselves.
</p>
<p>Under the Mosaic law, the tribe of Levi was set apart, to make it
the special business of their lives, in all their generations, to
understand its ordinances and ceremonies that they might be capable
of acting in behalf of the people, who were engaged in the ordinary
avocations of life. This labor was accepted by the Lord, in behalf of
the people, as though they had done it for themselves.
</p>
<p>The ordinances described in the 16th <em>chap</em>. of <em>Lev</em>., which the High
Priest was required to perform as an atonement for the sins of the
house of Israel, clearly illustrates this principle. It is said of the
scapegoat, "And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the
live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of
Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them
upon the head of the goat, and shall send <em>him</em> away by the hand of a
fit man into the wilderness;" 16. 21. This confession of the sins of
the people, by the High Priest, was a vicarious work, and was accepted
by the Lord as though they had confessed their own sins, with their
hands upon the head of the goat&mdash;a work evidently impracticable for
them to do.
</p>
<p>The vicarious nature of the sufferings of Christ are clearly foretold
in the prophetic vision of Isaiah: "Surely he hath borne our griefs,
and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of
God, and afflicted. But he <em>was</em> wounded for our transgressions, <em>he
was</em> bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace <em>was</em>
upon him; and with his stripes we are healed;" 53. 4, 5. The same
prophet speaking further of Christ says, that he should be "For a
covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;" 42. 6. Evidently
referring to his earthly mission in which this was literally fulfilled.
</p>
<p>At the time when this should take place, there was another labor which
he was to perform. He was "To open the blind eyes, to bring out the
prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the
prison house;" <em>verse</em> 7. This passage informs us that there was a
class of persons who were confined in a dark, benighted prison, who
were to be delivered when Christ should be "For a covenant of the
people, for a light of the Gentiles."
</p>
<p>The Apostle Peter informs us that Jesus, between his death and
resurrection, when his spirit was free from his body, went and preached
to the spirits in prison. "For Christ also hath once suffered for sins,
the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to
death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: By which also he went
and preached unto the spirits in prison;" 1 <em>Pet</em>. 3. 18, 19. In the
context he informs us that these spirits were those, of the people, who
were disobedient in the days of Noah.
</p>
<p>The Apostle Peter had no narrow views of the plan of salvation, for
when he speaks of Christ suffering, "the just for the unjust," he makes
no discrimination in favor of the living. For the assertion is sweeping
and universal, that Christ died for all; else what profit could there
be in Christ's preaching to the spirits in prison, unless the way was
opened for them to receive the ordinances and blessings of the Gospel,
in common with the living?
</p>
<p>Peter positively informs us that the Gospel was preached to the dead,
and the reason why, "For, for this cause was the Gospel preached also
to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in
the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit;" 4. 6. If they are
judged according to men in the flesh, it would evidently be unjust, if
they should not have the benefit of all the ordinances and privileges
that pertain to the living. To the question, How can the dead receive
the ordinances of the Gospel? there can be but one answer&mdash;by proxy; by
the vicarious works of the living.
</p>
<p>Not only did Peter assert that the Gospel was preached to the spirits
in prison, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but
the Apostle Paul informs us that the first Gospel ordinance, of all
dispensations&mdash;baptism, was administered by proxy among the former-day
Saints.
</p>
<p>Speaking of the resurrection, he asks the Corinthian Saints, "Else
what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise
not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?" 1 <em>Cor</em>. 15. 29.
That is, of what utility are baptisms for the dead, if there is no
resurrection? This doctrine was evidently neither strange nor new to
those to whom the Apostles were writing.
</p>
<p>Paul further says, "For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and
revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living;" <em>Rom</em>. 14.
9. If this passage asserts anything, it is that Christ died for the
dead as well as the living. Again, there is here no discrimination made
in favor of the living.
</p>
<p>Jesus gave some light on this subject, when talking with the Jews on
marrying and the resurrection: "Neither can they die any more: for
they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the
children of the resurrection. * * * For he is not a God of the dead,
but of the living: for all live unto him;" <em>Luke</em> 20. 36, 38. The
following may be inferred from these passages: that notwithstanding
men die, they must live unto God through the resurrection, and as
myriads have died without a knowledge of the Gospel, they must have an
opportunity of enjoying its blessings, in order to live unto God, after
they have come forth from the dead.
</p>
<p>The prophet Malachi, in vision, saw our day, over 2200 years ago. In
the closing chapter of his prophecy and of the Old Testament, he says,
"For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all
the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the
day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it
shall leave them neither root nor branch;" 4. 1. But there is another
important event to take place before that day, as we learn in <em>verses</em>
5 &amp; 6: "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming
of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: and he shall turn the heart
of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their
fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse."
</p>
<p>Elijah's coming must evidently be to some one who is prepared to
receive him, and to labor in the great work he is sent to inaugurate,
for the expression, "He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the
children, and the heart of the children to their fathers," is very
comprehensive. It does not discriminate between the living and the
dead, between the past and the future. It pertains to the whole family
of Adam.
</p>
<p>Moroni, the heavenly messenger who ministered to Joseph Smith, Jun.,
makes the universality of the work to be accomplished still plainer:
"And he shall plant in the hearts of the children, the promises made
to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their
fathers; if it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at
his coming;" <em>P. of G. P</em>., p. 50.
</p>
<p>"It is sufficient to know, in this case, that the earth will be smitten
with a curse, unless there is a welding link of some kind or other,
between the fathers and the children, upon some subject or other, and
behold what is that subject? It is the baptism for the dead. For we
without them cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be
made perfect.
</p>
<p>"Neither can they nor we be made perfect, without those who have
died in the Gospel also; for it is necessary in the ushering in of
the dispensation of the fulness of times; which dispensation is now
beginning to usher in, that a whole and complete and perfect union, and
welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers, and glories
should take place, and be revealed from the days of Adam even to the
present time; and not only this, but those things which never have
been kept hid from the foundation of the world, but have been kept hid
from the wise and prudent, shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings
in this the dispensation of the fulness of times;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov., sec</em>.
128. 18.
</p>
<p>The time came for Elijah to appear and fill his great and glorious
mission. The place was prepared, and the men were there who had the
faith to receive him, and the authority and power he was to bring to
men in the flesh, to administer in the ordinances of the Gospel for the
dead.
</p>
<p>He appeared to Joseph, the Seer, and O. Cowdery, in the Kirtland
Temple, April 3d, 1836, and said, "Behold, the time has fully come,
which was spoken of by the mouth of Malachi, testifying that he
(Elijah) should be sent before the great and dreadful day of the Lord
come, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the
children to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse.
Therefore the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands,
and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is
near, even at the doors;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov., sec</em>. 110. 14, 15, 16.
</p>
<p>Ordinances for the salvation of the dead require temples, or sacred
places especially constructed for their administration. The former-day
Saints usually remained in the same scattered condition in which
they received the Gospel. For these reasons, it is probable that the
doctrines pertaining to the salvation of the dead were imperfectly
taught. This may account for so little being said in the New Testament
on this subject.

<a name="remission"></a><h2>REMISSION OF SINS.
</h2>
<p>This subject is closely connected with the fall of man and the
atonement of our Savior. The fall was brought about by a law being
given to him, in the Garden of Eden. He broke that law, and the fall
was the penalty of transgression.
</p>
<p>The atonement opens up the way for the removal of that penalty; and
also for the removal of the effects of men's individual sins through
repentance. It is through obedience to certain laws and ordinances,
deriving their efficacy from the atonement of Christ, that men's sins
are remitted.
</p>
<p>Man, in his weak and fallen state, is ever prone to sin. God, in his
great love and mercy, has provided a way through which his sins may
be forgiven. Besides the outward ordinances of the Gospel, there are
three general conditions which the sinner must fulfil, in order to have
his sins remitted. He must confess them and ask forgiveness; <em>Doc.
&amp; Cov</em>., 64. 7. He must forgive others of their trespasses. Christ
taught his disciples, "For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your
Heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their
trespasses, neither will your Heavenly Father forgive your trespasses;"
<em>Matt</em>. 6. 14, 15.
</p>
<p>The Lord said to his prophet Joseph, "Ye ought to forgive one another,
for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses, standeth
condemned before the Lord, for there remaineth in him the greater sin;"
<em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>, 64. 9. The third condition is, men must continually
bear in mind the atonement of Christ. The Nephite Saints continually
looked forward to the atonement of Christ, "Thus retaining a remission
of their sins;" <em>Alma</em> 4. 13, 14. We are often taught in the sacred
writings to make our supplications to the Father, in the name of his
Son Jesus Christ, who has become a propitiation for sin. The works
necessary to attain to a remission of sins, and the results of that
remission, are well expressed by the Nephite prophet, Moroni:
</p>
<p>"And the first fruits of repentance is baptism; and baptism cometh by
faith, unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the fulfilling the
commandments bringeth remission of sins; and the remission of sins
bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart, and because of meekness and
lowliness of heart, cometh the visitation of the Holy Ghost, which
Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love, which love endureth by
diligence unto prayer, until the end shall come, when all the Saints
shall dwell with God;" <em>Moroni</em> 8. 25, 26.

<h2>LAYING ON OF HANDS.
</h2>
<a name="ordination"></a><h3>FOR ORDINATION.
</h3>
<p>Ordinations to offices in the holy Priesthood are sometimes mentioned
in both the Old and New Testaments, when it is not stated in the
context that it was by the imposition of hands. The apostle Paul
exhorted Timothy, "Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was
given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the
presbytery;" 1 <em>Tim</em>. 4. 14. The inference is reasonable, that Paul
here refers to an ordination to some office in the Priesthood.
</p>
<p>Paul again said to Timothy, "Stir up the gift of God, which is in thee
by the putting on of my hands;" 2 <em>Tim</em>. 1. 6.
</p>
<p>The Lord revealed to Joseph the prophet, that the Priesthood descended
from Adam to Noah under the HANDS OF THE FATHERS; <em>Doc &amp; Cov</em>. 107.
40-52.
</p>
<p>We are further informed that "Abraham received the Priesthood from
Melchisedek, who received it through the lineage of his fathers, even
till Noah;" 84. 14. Esaias, who lived in the days of Abraham, "received
it under the hands of God;" from him it descended under the hands of
the fathers to Moses; 6-13.
</p>
<p>In this dispensation all the offices and authority of the Priesthood
are conferred by the laying on of hands. The first ordination to the
Priesthood, in this dispensation, was under the hands of John the
Baptist; <em>Doc. &amp; Cov., sec</em>. 13. The angel, John the Baptist, commanded
Joseph Smith and O. Cowdery to baptize each other. The prophet says:
"Accordingly we went and were baptized, I baptized him first, and
afterwards he baptized me, after which I laid my hands upon his head
and ordained him to the Aaronic Priesthood, afterwards he laid his
hands on me and ordained me to the same Priesthood&mdash;for so were we
commanded;" <em>His. of J. Smith, May</em> 15, 1829.
</p>
<p>The same order as was observed in the ordination to the Aaronic
Priesthood, was also observed by Joseph Smith and O. Cowdery in their
ordination to the Melchisedek Priesthood; <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 20. 3, 4,
<em>sec</em>. 21. 10-12.
</p>
<a name="giftofhg"></a><h3>FOR THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST.
</h3>
<p>The laying on of hands for the reception of the Holy Ghost,
characterized the primitive Gospel dispensation, as recorded in the New
Testament. Peter and John laid their hands on the people of Samaria,
who had been baptized, and they received the Holy Ghost; <em>Acts</em> 8. 17.
</p>
<p>Ananias laid hands on Saul, by special commandment, before he was
baptized, that he might receive his sight and be filled with the Holy
Ghost; 9. 17.
</p>
<p>Paul found some people at Ephesus, that claimed to be disciples of
John the Baptist, who had not even heard of the Holy Ghost. When he
had baptized them, "and when he had laid his hands upon them, the Holy
Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues and prophesied;" 19.
2-6.
</p>
<p>The laying on of hands for the reception of the Holy Ghost
characterized both the Mosaic and Gospel dispensations among the
Nephites. "Now it came to pass that when Alma had said these words,
that he clapped his hands upon all them who were with him. And behold,
as he clapped his hands upon them, they were filled with the Holy
Spirit;" <em>Alma</em> 31. 36. We are informed that the Nephites, at this
time, were very strict in observing the ordinances of God according to
the law of Moses; 30. 3.
</p>
<p>When our Savior organized the Council of Twelve Apostles among the
Nephites, he touched them with his hand and gave them power to give
the Holy Ghost. "And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end
of these sayings, he touched with his hand the disciples whom he had
chosen, one by one, even until he had touched them all, and spake unto
them as he touched them; and the multitude heard not the words which
he spake, therefore they did not bear record; but the disciples bear
record that he gave them power to give the Holy Ghost;" 3 <em>Nephi</em> 18.
36, 37.
</p>
<p>The Apostles of this dispensation are especially instructed to lay
hands on those who have been baptized into the church, "For the baptism
of fire and the Holy Ghost, according to the scriptures;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>.
20. 41.
</p>
<p>When the few who had received the Gospel first met to organize the
church, the prophet Joseph laid his hands on O. Cowdery and ordained
him an elder in the church, after which O. Cowdery ordained the prophet
Joseph to the same office. They then administered the sacrament to the
Saints. Afterwards they laid their hands "on each individual member of
the church present, that they might receive the gift of the Holy Ghost,
and be confirmed members of the Church of Christ;" <em>His. of J. Smith,
April</em> 6, 1830. This was the first time in this dispensation that hands
were publicly laid on for the bestowal of the Holy Ghost, and for
confirmation.
</p>
<a name="healingthesick"></a><h3>FOR HEALING THE SICK.
</h3>
<p>Jesus Christ has left us his example for laying hands on the sick, that
they might be healed. He touched the hand of Peter's wife's mother, and
the fever left her; <em>Matt</em>. 8. 15. "He laid his hands upon a few sick
folk, and healed them;" <em>Mark</em> 6. 5.
</p>
<p>About the close of his earthly mission, Jesus said to his disciples,
"Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature;"
and promised them that if they would lay hands on the sick, they should
recover; 16. 15, 18.
</p>
<p>"By the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among
the people;" <em>Acts</em> 5. 12.
</p>
<p>The Lord, through his prophet, Joseph, has commanded his people to
administer to the sick by the laying on of hands. "And whosoever among
you are sick, and have not faith to be healed, but believe, shall be
nursed with all tenderness, with herbs and mild food, and that not by
the hand of an enemy. And the elders of the church, two or more, shall
be called, and shall pray for and lay their hands upon them in my name;
and if they die they shall die unto me, and if they live they shall
live unto me;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>., 42. 43, 44.
</p>
<p>The ordinance of laying on of hands for the bestowal of authority,
power and blessing has characterized all the dispensations of the holy
Priesthood. But it does not necessarily follow that the Creator may not
bestow these favors in other ways.
</p>
<p>Before the flood, the Lord said to Enoch, "Anoint thine eyes with clay,
and wash them, and thou shalt see;" and the spiritual creations were
opened to his vision; <em>P. of G. P., p</em>. 15.
</p>
<p>Naaman, the Syrian, was cleansed of his leprosy by washing seven times
in Jordan; 2 <em>Kings</em> 5. 10-14.
</p>
<p>The blind man, after Jesus had anointed his eyes with clay, received
his sight by washing them in the pool of Siloam; <em>John</em> 9. 7. Contrary
to the usual custom, Ananias laid hands on Saul, before he was
baptized, that he might be filled with the Holy Ghost; <em>Acts</em> 9. 17.

<a name="resurrection"></a><h2>THE RESURRECTION.
</h2>
<p>What little knowledge we have of this doctrine we have received from
Jesus Christ, the author of it, and from those whom he has sent to
teach mankind. From these we learn that a resurrection has occurred,
and that there will be others at different periods of time, as well as
under different circumstances.
</p>
<p>The resurrection is predicated on the death or dissolution of the
earth, and all organizations pertaining to it. As the fall of Adam
brought death or dissolution, so the death and resurrection of Christ
will bring to pass a restoration to life, of all creatures that have
been affected by the fall.
</p>
<a name="christresurrection"></a><h3>AT CHRIST'S RESURRECTION.
</h3>
<p>That Christ well understood the great object of his earthly mission,
is evident from many of his sayings previous to his death and
resurrection. Early in his ministry he said to Nicodemus, "As Moses
lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be
lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
eternal life;" <em>John</em> 3. 14, 15.
</p>
<p>On another occasion Jesus said to Martha the sister of Lazarus, "I am
the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he were
dead, yet shall he live;" <em>John</em> 11. 25. At another time, in talking
with the Pharisees, he said, "Therefore doth my Father love me, because
I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from
me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and to
take it up again;" <em>John</em> 10. 17, 18.
</p>
<p>We are informed that one resurrection has already taken place, and that
it occurred at the resurrection of our Savior. "And the graves were
opened; and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose, and came out
of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and
appeared unto many;" <em>Matt</em>. 27. 52, 53.
</p>
<p>The following indicates that the prophet Isaiah had a prophetic glimpse
of this resurrection; "Thy dead <em>men</em> shall live, <em>together</em> with my
dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for
thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead;"
<em>Isa</em>. 26. 19.
</p>
<p>It would appear that the Psalmist, David, looked forward for redemption
from the dead, at the resurrection of Christ. "My flesh also shall rest
in hope. For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou
suffer thine Holy One to see corruption;" <em>Psalm</em> 16. 9, 10.
</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon is much more definite and comprehensive on this
subject than the Bible. "And there cometh a resurrection, even a first
resurrection; yea, even a resurrection of those that have been, and
who are, and who shall be, even until the resurrection of Christ: for
so shall he be called. And now, the resurrection of all the prophets,
and all those that have believed in their words, or all those that
have kept the commandments of God, shall come forth in the first
resurrection; therefore, they are the first resurrection * * * And
these are those who have part in the first resurrection; and these are
they that have died before Christ came in their ignorance, not having
salvation declared unto them. And thus the Lord bringeth about the
restoration of these; and they have a part in the first resurrection,
or have eternal life, being redeemed by the Lord. And little children
also have eternal life;" <em>Mos</em>. 15. 21-25.
</p>
<p>This declaration of the prophet-king, Mosiah, was made about 100 B. C.
Alma, who lived and prophesied a few years later, says, "And behold,
again it hath been spoken, that there is a first resurrection; a
resurrection of all those who have been, or who are, or who shall be,
down to the resurrection of Christ from the dead;" <em>Alma</em> 40. 16.
</p>
<p>From these passages quoted from the Book of Mormon, and their
contexts, it is evident that the Nephite Saints looked forward to the
resurrection of Christ from the dead, for their deliverance from the
grave, with the same assurance that the Latter-day Saints anticipate
their resurrection at his second coming.
</p>
<p>By way of explanation, the prophet Alma adds, "The resurrection meaneth
the re-uniting of the soul with the body of those from the days of
Adam, down to the resurrection of Christ;" 40. 18, 19.
</p>
<p>The Lamanite prophet, Samuel, speaking of the resurrection of Christ,
says, "And many graves shall be opened, and shall yield up many of
their dead; and many Saints shall appear unto many;" <em>Hel</em>. 14. 25.
During Christ's ministry among the Nephites, his disciples testified
that this prophecy was fulfilled; 3 <em>Nephi</em> 23. 10.

</p>
<a name="second"></a><h3>AT THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST.
</h3>
<p>Those who have lived and died since the resurrection of Christ, in the
hope of a resurrection from the dead, are looking forward to the time
of his coming, in the latter days, for their redemption from the grave.
"Even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For
this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive
and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are
asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the
dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive <em>and</em> remain
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord
in the air;" 1 <em>Thess</em>. 4. 14-17.
</p>
<p>Christ said to his Nephite disciples who were to remain until his
coming, "When I shall come in my glory, ye shall be changed in the
twinkling of an eye from mortality to immortality;" 3 <em>Nephi</em> 28. 8.
</p>
<p>The Lord said to Joseph Smith, the Seer, "Behold, I will come; and they
shall see me in the clouds of heaven, clothed with power and great
glory, with all the holy angels; and he that watches not for me shall
be cut off; * * and the Saints that have slept shall come forth to meet
me in the cloud;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>., 45. 44, 45.
</p>
<p>We have seen by previous reference to the Book of Mormon, that the
heathen nations, and those who knew no law, should be resurrected when
Christ arose from the dead. The Lord revealed to Joseph, the Seer, that
this should also take place when he comes in his glory. "And then shall
the heathen nations be redeemed, and they that knew no law shall have
part in the first resurrection;" <em>verse</em> 54.
</p>
<p>The Lord gave Joseph, the Seer, a further description of this glorious
event. "And immediately after shall the curtain of heaven be unfolded,
as a scroll is unfolded after it is rolled up, and the face of the Lord
shall be unveiled; and the Saints that are upon the earth, who are
alive, shall be quickened, and be caught up to meet him. And they who
have slept in their graves shall come forth; for their graves shall be
opened, and they also shall be caught up to meet him in the midst of
the pillar of heaven: They are Christ's, the first fruits: they who
shall descend with him first, and they who are on the earth and in
their graves, who are first caught up to meet him;" 88. 95-98.
</p>
<p>Then comes the redemption of those who have received their part in
that prison that is prepared for them; <em>verse</em> 99. "Then cometh the
spirits of men who are to be judged, and are found under condemnation;
and these are the rest of the dead, and they live not again until the
thousand years are ended, neither again, until the end of the earth;"
<em>verses</em> 100 and 101. These appear to be the only ones of the family of
man whose bodies remain in their graves until the last resurrection.
</p>

<p><em>Dan</em>. 12. 2 many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall

</p>
<p>88. 100 then cometh the spirits of men who are still under condemnation.
</p>
<a name="end"></a><h3>RESURRECTION AT THE END OF THE WORLD.
</h3>
<p>John, the Revelator, has left us a short description of this
resurrection, and of the judgment connected with it. "And I saw the
dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and
another book was opened, which is <em>the book of life</em>: and the dead were
judged out of those things which were written in the books, according
to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and
death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them; and they were
judged every man according to their works;" <em>Rev</em>. 20. 12, 13.
</p>
<p>At that time, the earth, having filled the measure of its creation, in
this order of things, will undergo a change that will fit it for the
residence of exalted, celestial beings; "And I saw a new heaven and a
new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away;"
21. 1.
</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon, also gives some account of this final resurrection;
"And they shall come forth, both small and great, and all shall stand
before his bar, being redeemed and loosed from the eternal band of
death;" <em>Mormon</em> 9. 13.
</p>
<p>The Jaredite prophet, Ether, who lived on the American continent 600
years before the Savior was born, predicted this great change in the
earth; "And there shall be a new heaven and a new earth; and they shall
be like unto the old, save the old have passed away, and all things
shall become new;" <em>Ether</em> 13. 9.
</p>
<p>Joseph, the Seer of the present dispensation, has given us a more
comprehensive view of this subject than has come down from other
dispensations; "And the end shall come, and the heaven and the earth
shall be consumed and pass away, and there shall be a new heaven and
a new earth, for all old things shall pass away, and all things shall
become new, even the heaven and the earth, and all the fulness thereof,
both men and beasts, the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea;
and not one hair, neither mote, shall be lost;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>., 29.
23-25.
</p>
<p>Both the wicked and the righteous will be resurrected; <em>verses</em> 26, 27.
That the final change in the earth will be equivalent to a resurrection
is evident from the following: "Wherefore it shall be sanctified; yea,
notwithstanding it shall die, it shall be quickened again, and shall
abide the power by which it is quickened;" 88. 26.
</p>
<p><b>Bible.

<a name="laiddown"></a><h3>RESURRECTION OF THE BODY THAT IS LAID DOWN.
</h3>
<p>When Job said, "Though after my skin <em>worms</em> destroy this body, yet in
my flesh shall I see God;" 19. 26; it is evident that he believed that
though his body should be disorganized, yet, in his own flesh, and not
in that of another, he should see God. As if to confirm his assertion,
he further adds, "Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall
behold, and not another;" <em>verse</em> 27.
</p>
<p>A literal resurrection was manifested to Ezekiel in his vision of the
resurrection of the house of Israel; 37. 1-14.
</p>
<p>When Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, and said, "This
is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead;" <em>Matt</em>. 14. 1, 2; he
probably, in common with the Jews, believed in a literal resurrection.
</p>
<p>Jesus said to his disciples, "Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I
myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as
ye see me have;" <em>Luke</em> 24. 39; <em>John</em> 20. 27; <em>Acts</em> 10. 41. "He that
raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies;"
<em>Rom</em>. 8. 11. That is, their bodies that died, and not some other
bodies.
</p>
<p>The apostle Paul gives us some light on this subject: "But some <em>man</em>
will say, How are the dead raised? and with what body do they come?
<em>Thou</em> fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die; *
* thou sowest not that body that shall be. * * But God giveth it a body
as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body. All flesh is
not the same flesh: but <em>there is one kind of</em> flesh of men, another
flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds;" 1 <em>Cor</em>. 15.
35-39.
</p>
<p>The apostle evidently considers the old body the germ of a new body,
which will be like the old, but a new growth, even as new grain is
produced from that which is sown.
</p>
<p>It is also evident that the apostle considered it impossible for one
kind of flesh to mingle with another in the resurrection, as they
widely differ, from different combinations of the elements, in their
organization. As well might we expect the different grades of spiritual
organizations, to intermingle, as the different kinds of flesh of which
their material bodies are composed.
</p>
<p>The following is from the <em>Times and Seasons, vol. 5, page</em> 617:
"Mothers, you shall have your children, for they shall have eternal
life: for their debt is paid, there is no damnation awaits them, for
they are in the spirit. As the child dies, so shall it rise from the
dead and be forever living in the learning of God; it shall be the
child, the same as it was before it died out of your arms. Children
dwell and exercise power in the same from as they laid them down."
</p>
<p>In the <em>History of Joseph Smith</em>, under date of April 7, 1843, we find
the following very pointed assertion on this subject: "There is no
fundamental principle belonging to a human system that ever goes into
another in this world or in the world to come: I care not what the
theories of men are. We have the testimony that God will raise us up,
and he has the power to do it. If any supposes that any part of our
bodies, that is the fundamental parts thereof, ever goes into another
body, he is mistaken."

<a name="holypriesthood"></a><h2>THE HOLY PRIESTHOOD.
</h2>
<p>"There are, in the church, two Priesthoods, namely, the Melchisedek and
Aaronic, including the Levitical Priesthood. Why the first is called
the Melchisedek Priesthood, is because Melchisedek was such a great
High Priest. Before his day it was called <em>the Holy Priesthood, after
the Order of the Son of God</em>. * * * All other authorities or offices in
the church are appendages to this Priesthood;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 107. 1-5.
</p>
<p>In the ordinances of this Priesthood "The power of Godliness is
manifest; and without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the
Priesthood, the power of Godliness is not manifest unto men in the
flesh;" 84. 20, 21.
</p>
<p>This Priesthood, or <em>Order of the Son of God</em>. is "Without father,
without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor
end of life;" <em>Heb</em>. 7. 3. Its authority and powers have ever existed,
and there has never been wanting intelligences to manifest them through
its ordinances.
</p>
<p>"This greater Priesthood administereth the Gospel and holdeth the key
of the mysteries of the kingdom even the key of the knowledge of God;"
<em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 84. 19. That this passage refers to a personal knowledge
of God is evident from <em>verse</em> 22, "For without this no man can see the
face of God, even the Father, and live." This is a distinct line drawn
between the two Priesthoods.
</p>
<p>That man could not attain to the knowledge which would admit him
to the presence of God, without the Melchisedek Priesthood, "Moses
plainly taught to the children of Israel in the wilderness, and sought
diligently to sanctify his people that they might behold the face of
God; but they hardened their hearts and could not endure his presence,
therefore the Lord in his wrath (for his anger was kindled against
them) swore that they should not enter into his rest while in the
wilderness, which rest is the fulness of his glory. Therefore he took
Moses out of their midst, and the Holy Priesthood also;" <em>verses</em> 23-25.
</p>
<p>The Latter-day Saints have this Priesthood, with its authority,
ordinances and blessings. How they have obtained it, is a very
important question. Peter was the chief of the apostles, in the Gospel
dispensation, from which we understand that the Presidency of the
Melchisedek Priesthood, in that dispensation, was vested in him, and
that it was through him that its succession could be again restored to
the earth. We find that in June, 1829, a revelation was given, making
known the calling of a Council of Twelve Apostles; <em>Doc &amp; Cov</em>. 18. 27.
</p>
<p>It is evident that between the fifteenth of May, 1829, and the time
when this revelation was given, in June following, Joseph Smith, Jun.,
O. Cowdery, and D. Whitmer were called to the Melchisedek Priesthood.
For the Lord, speaking to O. Cowdery and D. Whitmer, said, "I speak
unto you, even as unto Paul mine apostle, for you are called even with
the same calling with which he was called;" <em>verse</em> 9.
</p>
<p>While Joseph Smith, Jun., is not mentioned here as an apostle, we have
the information in a revelation given April, 1830, that he was the
first apostle and elder of this church, "Which commandments were given
to Joseph Smith, Jun., who was called of God, and ordained an APOSTLE
of Jesus Christ, to be the FIRST ELDER of this church; and to Oliver
Cowdery, who was also called of God, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to be
the SECOND ELDER of this church, and ordained under his hand;" <em>Doc. &amp;
Cov</em>. 20. 2, 3.
</p>
<p>We are informed in <em>sec</em>. 27. 12, under date of September, 1830, who
ordained them; "And also with Peter, and James, and John, whom I have
sent unto you, by whom I have ordained you and confirmed you to be
apostles, and especial witnesses of my name, and bear the keys of your
ministry, and of the same things which I revealed unto them."
</p>
<p>The presidency of Peter, James and John are plainly asserted in the
above passages; the thirteenth verse, with the context, informs us
that they bestowed the presidency of this dispensation on Joseph Smith
and others: "Unto whom I have committed the keys of my kingdom, and
a dispensation of the Gospel for the last time; and for the fulness
of times, in the which I will gather together in one all things, both
which are in heaven, and which are on earth." We are informed that
these primitive apostles also testified that they held this presidency
of the Melchisedek Priesthood: "The voice of Peter, James and John in
the wilderness between Harmony, Susquehanna County, and Colesville,
Broome County, on the Susquehanna river, declaring themselves as
possessing the keys of the kingdom, and of the dispensation of the
fulness of times;" 128. 20.
</p>
<p>In the thirty-seventh verse of <em>sec</em>. 18, the Lord designated O.
Cowdery and D. Whitmer as two men he had chosen to search out the then
future Twelve, whom the Lord declares, in the twenty-seventh verse were
already called. This selection, of the Council of Twelve Apostles, was
not made until February 14, 1835, over five years afterwards.
</p>
<p>The most comprehensive evidence that Joseph Smith. Jun., received the
authority and power of the Holy Priesthood, is that the works of John
the Baptist, of Jesus and his apostles, are being again done on the
earth by his administration. To receive the powers of this Priesthood,
it is necessary that men should obey the laws and ordinances of the
Gospel.
</p>
<p>The Lord has personally appeared to some men, and covenanted with them
as he did with Abraham; <em>Gen</em>. 12. 1-3. <em>chap</em>. 13. 14-17. The Lord
also personally called and authorized his twelve Jewish apostles. So
fully were they authorized to labor for him, and act in his name, that
he said to them, "He that receiveth you receiveth me; and he that
receiveth me receiveth him that sent me;" <em>Matt</em>. 10. 40.
</p>
<p>More generally, it is from the prophets and apostles of Christ that
men receive the Priesthood. Many received it under the hands of the
apostles of the first Gospel dispensation. Those who have received it
in this latter-day dispensation, have received it from Joseph Smith,
Jun., and O. Cowdery, and, in doing so, have received it through a
legitimate channel from God the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ. Those
who have received this Priesthood have covenanted with God the Father,
and he with them. This is evidently the view taken of the subject in
the above passage quoted from Matthew.
</p>
<p>The doctrine is more fully illustrated in <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>.: "All they
who receive this Priesthood receiveth me, saith the Lord; for he that
receiveth my servants receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth
my Father; and he that receiveth my Father, receiveth my Father's
kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him;
and this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the
Priesthood;" 84. 35-39.

<a name="aaronic"></a><h3>THE AARONIC PRIESTHOOD.
</h3>
<p>John the Baptist was the acknowledged forerunner of Christ, and, as
such, he preached the preparatory Gospel of repentance, and baptism
for the remission of sins. His father, Zacharias, was a priest of the
course of Abia, and his mother was of the daughters of Aaron; <em>Luke</em> 1.
5.
</p>
<p>Thus the Aaronic Priesthood was the heritage of John the Baptist.
His ministry evidences that he was clothed with its authority. That
the chain of evidence might be complete, regarding this fact, the
Lord revealed to Joseph Smith, Jun., that he was ordained to the
Aaronic Priesthood by an angel; <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 84. 28. Being the first
man ordained to it in the former Gospel dispensation, he holds the
presidency of that Priesthood in all subsequent dispensations.
</p>
<p>As a sequence, the man who should open up the last dispensation must
receive it from him. We have the testimony of Joseph Smith, Jun.,
and Oliver Cowdery, that John the Baptist did ordain them to this
Priesthood, using the following words, "Upon you my fellow servants, in
the name of Messiah, I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the
keys of the ministering of angels, and of the Gospel of repentance, and
of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never
be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer again an
offering unto the Lord in righteousness;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov., sec</em>. 13.
</p>
<p>"The messenger who visited us on this occasion, and conferred this
Priesthood upon us, said that his name was John, the same that is
called John the Baptist in the New Testament, and that he acted under
the direction of Peter, James and John, who held the keys of the
Priesthood of Melchisedek, which Priesthood he said should in due time
be conferred on us, and that I should be called the first Elder, and
Oliver the second. It was on the fifteenth day of May, 1829, that we
were ordained under the hand of the messenger and baptized;" <em>His. of
J. Smith, Jun., May</em> 15, 1829.
</p>
<p>Thus was the succession of the Lesser Priesthood again restored to the
earth.

found the following: "An Evangelist is a Patriarch, even the oldest man
of the blood of Joseph or of the seed of Abraham. Whenever the Church
of Christ is established in the earth, there should be a Patriarch for
the benefit of the posterity of the Saints, as it was with Jacob in
giving his patriarchal blessing unto his sons," etc.
</p>
<p>As the singular number is here used, exclusively, doubtless the Prophet
Joseph, in the above passage, speaks of then Patriarch of the whole
church.

<p>In the <em>History of Joseph Smith</em>, under date of September 14, 1840, we
are informed that Joseph Smith, Sen., Patriarch of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints, died at Nauvoo. In a biographical sketch
of him, of the same date, we are informed that he was ordained to this
office, on the eighteenth of December, 1833.
</p>
<p>The distinguishing feature between his calling and that of other
patriarchs is, that he was patriarch of the whole church, while others
were ordained patriarchs in the church. Of the latter was John Young,
Sen., who was ordained a patriarch in the church by the Prophet Joseph
Smith, in 1834; <em>His. of J. Smith, under date of Aug</em>. 8, 1844.
</p>
<p>"It is the duty of the Twelve, in all large branches of the church,
to ordain evangelical ministers, (or patriarchs), as they shall be
designated unto them by revelation;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 107. 39.
</p>
<p>"The order of this (patriarchal) Priesthood was confirmed, to be handed
down from father to son, and rightly belongs to the literal descendants
of the chosen seed, to whom the promises were made. This order was
instituted in the days of Adam, and came down by lineage;" <em>verses</em>
40-57.
</p>
<p>From the last quotation it is evident that if a man holds the High
Priesthood, by virtue of that Priesthood he is patriarch over his own
posterity, and as such has a right to bestow upon them patriarchal
blessings.
</p>
<p>A little more than four months after the death of the Patriarch, Joseph
Smith, Sen., in a revelation given to his son Joseph, occurs the
following: "That my servant Hyrum may take the office of Priesthood and
Patriarch, which was appointed unto him by his father, <em>by blessing
and also by right</em>, that from henceforth he shall hold the keys of the
patriarchal blessings upon the heads of all my people, that whoever
he blesses shall be blessed, and whoever he curses shall be cursed;
that whatsoever he shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and
whatsoever he shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven;" <em>Doc. &amp;
Cov</em>. 124. 91-93.
</p>
<p>From this we learn, that Joseph Smith, Sen., inherited the Patriarchal
Priesthood, by right from the fathers over the house of Israel in this
dispensation. For this right to have descended to him, by lineage,
he must of necessity be an Ephraimite, for Ephraim, by the right of
appointment and ordination by his father Jacob, is the head of Israel.
This fact is plainly stated in the Scriptures: "Now the sons of Reuben
the firstborn of Israel, for he was the firstborn; but, forasmuch as
he defiled his father's bed, his birthright was given unto the sons of
Joseph the son of Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after
the birthright;" 1 <em>Chron</em>. 5. 1.
</p>
<p>Just before his death, in blessing Ephraim and Manasseh, Jacob adopted
the sons of Joseph as his own. Said he, "Let my name be named on them,
and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac;" <em>Gen</em>. 48. 16. For this
reason, these two sons of Joseph, each, had a name as the head of
tribes in Israel, "and he set Ephraim before Manasseh;" <em>Gen</em>. 48. 20.
</p>
<p>The Lord further declared through his prophet Jeremiah, "I am a father
to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn;" 31. 9.
</p>
<p>By virtue of this adoption of Ephraim, as the head of the house of
Israel, and Joseph Smith, Sen., being the oldest son of Ephraim,
holding the Priesthood in this dispensation, he is Patriarch of the
whole church, by right. This right should be perpetuated in his family,
as the oldest branch of the tribe of Ephraim.
</p>
<p>If, from any cause, there should be failure of a son to exercise this
right, then the office would be filled from the next eldest branch of
the family.
</p>
<p>This has been the case in the short history of the church. When Joseph
and Hyrum were martyred, the latter had no son old enough to fill the
office of patriarch, and John, his eldest living brother, was ordained
to the office vacated by his death.
</p>
<p>After the death of father John Smith, the office reverted back to the
family of Hyrum Smith, for his oldest son John had grown to manhood,
and was ordained Patriarch of the whole church.

<a name="CHRIST'SFIRSTCOMING"></a><h2>CHRIST'S FIRST COMING.
</h2>
<p>The oldest Bible prophecy, of the coming of Christ, is in Jacob's
blessing on Judah: "The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a
lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come;" <em>Gen</em>. 49. 10.
</p>
<p>When Christ was born, the sceptre had not wholly departed from Judah,
for Herod the king, who reigned at the time of his birth, was virtually
king of Judea. Christ was condemned to be crucified by Pontius Pilate,
a Roman governor. The Shiloh had come and the sceptre had entirely
departed, for Judah was under Gentile rule.
</p>
<p>The records of three dispensations assert that Christ came to his own,
and they did not receive him; <em>John</em> 1. 11. 3 <em>Nephi</em> 9. 16. <em>Doc. &amp;
Cov</em>. 6. 21. He came to his own covenant people, the house of Israel,
and, though they still retained most of the forms of the Mosaic ritual,
they had apostatized from the faith of their fathers, had drank deep
into pagan philosophy, had become wicked and corrupt, and, when the
Shiloh came, they new him not, rejected him, and were the means of his
death.
</p>
<p>The numerous prophecies of the first coming of Christ, in both the
Jewish and Nephite records, had a veritable fulfilment in his birth,
life, sufferings, death and resurrection, and furnish overwhelming
testimony of the Divine inspiration of those records. That Jesus Christ
was the same being who called Abraham from his native country, who led
Israel out of the land of Egypt with mighty miracles and wonders, who
made known to them his law amid the thunderings of Sinai, who delivered
them from their enemies, who chastened them for their disobedience, who
inspired their prophets, and whose glory filled Solomon's temple, is
evident from all the inspired writings, and in none more so than in the
Bible.
</p>
<p>His lamentation over Jerusalem evidences that, in his humanity, he had
not forgotten his former exalted position: "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto
thee, how often <em>would I have gathered</em> thy children together, * * and
ye would not;" <em>Matt</em>. 23. 37. It was this creator of the world, this
mighty ruler, this controller of the destinies of the human family,
who, in his last moments, cried out in the agony of his soul, "My God,
my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" <em>Mark</em> 15. 34.
</p>
<p>He was the great sacrifice for the world's redemption. It was a
sacrifice worthy of Deity. How grandly, how nobly it was made! It
was made in the meridian of time, and it changed the character of
dispensations. Israel ceased to be a nation, and the Gentile rule was
ushered in, to continue for many long centuries, in which God's chosen
people were to suffer terrible persecutions. We must look at Jesus
Christ in his true character of God and Savior, in order to form a
proper conception of the great sacrifice which has opened, to the human
family, the way to immortality.

<a name="Second"></a><h2>CHRIST'S SECOND COMING.
</h2>
<p>Christ's first coming attracted comparatively little attention. He was
born a helpless infant, under very humble circumstances. Through the
ministration of an angel, a few shepherds rejoiced over his advent,
and some wise men, who must have known of, and believed in prophecies
concerning him, visited and made presents to him. They were warned
to leave the country in a private manner, on account of the evil
designs of Herod. He grew up in obscurity, performed his labors in the
ministry, in affliction and persecution and apparently, to men, died
the death of a malefactor.
</p>
<p>At his second appearance he will come "With clouds; and every eye shall
see him, and they also which pierced him; and all kindreds of the earth
shall wail because of him;" <em>Rev</em>. 1, 7. "Behold the Lord cometh with
ten thousand of his saints, to execute judgment upon all;" <em>Jude</em> 14,
15. "He shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river unto
the ends of the earth;" <em>Psalm</em> 72. 8. "Yea, all kings shall fall down
before him; all nations shall serve him;" <em>verse</em> 11. "The Son of Man
shall come down in heaven, clothed in the brightness of his glory, to
meet the kingdom of God which is set up on the earth;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>.
65. 5.
</p>
<p>When will Christ come in his glory and power? This question many
millions of the human family have asked, and the query still remains
unanswered. Jesus said to his disciples, "Be ye therefore ready also:
for the Son of Man cometh at an hour when ye think not;" <em>Luke</em> 12. 40.
"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night;" 2 <em>Pet</em>.
3. 10. "But the hour and the day no man knoweth, neither the angels in
heaven, nor shall they know until he comes;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 49. 7.
</p>
<p>The Lord has not told us that there shall be no period of time
designated in which he will come, but that neither the day nor the
hour shall be known. Had we a correct chronology we might, perhaps,
approximate very closely to the year, for according to <em>Sec</em>. 77. 12,
it will be in the beginning of the seventh thousand years. It will be
a time of destruction for the wicked; "The Lord shall punish the host
of the high ones <em>that are</em> on high, and the kings of the earth upon
the earth;" <em>Isa</em>. 24. 21. "The Lord who shall come down upon the world
with a curse to judgment; yea, upon all the nations that forget God,
and upon all the ungodly among you;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 133. 2.
</p>
<p>There will be great commotion and changes in the elements; "The
foundations of the earth do shake. The earth is utterly broken down,
the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly. The earth
shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a
cottage; and the transgressions thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it
shall fall, and not rise again;" <em>Isa</em>. 24. 18-20.
</p>
<p>The fulfilment of the prophecies and the signs of the times indicate
that the coming of the Son of Man is nigh at hand. The Lord through
Joseph, the Seer, also informs us that this is the case. "Not many days
hence and the earth shall tremble and reel to and fro as a drunken man,
and the sun shall hide his face, and shall refuse to give light, and
the moon shall be bathed in blood, and the stars shall become exceeding
angry, and shall cast themselves down as a fig that falleth from off a
fig tree;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 88. 87.
</p>
<p>Israel requested Moses, when around Mount Horeb, that they might no
more hear the voice of the Lord, nor see his glory, lest they should
die. They had not faith to behold his presence, and the law of carnal
commandments was given them. When they were about to enter into the
land of their inheritance, Moses rehearsed these things to them, and
repeated what the Lord had said to him concerning a future prophet: "I
will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee,
and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all
that I shall command him. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever
will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will
require it of him;" <em>Deut</em>. 18. 18, 19. The Book of Mormon informs us
that this prophet was Jesus Christ: "Behold, I am he of whom Moses
spake, saying, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of
your brethren, like unto me;" 3 <em>Nephi</em> 20. 23.
</p>
<p>Peter, when he reproved the Jews for killing the "Prince of life,"
repeated this prophecy, rendering the latter part of it a little
plainer: "Every soul, which will not hear that Prophet shall be cut off
from among the people;" <em>Acts</em> 3. 22, 23. It is evident from <em>verses</em>
19-21, that the time when those who would not hear that prophet should
be cut off, would be at the time of the restitution of all things, when
he whose right it is shall reign, and the kingdoms of this world shall
become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ.
</p>
<p>The prophet Joseph says, "I was once praying very earnestly to know the
time of the coming of the Son of Man, when I heard a voice repeat the
following&mdash;'Joseph, my son, if thou livest until thou art eighty-five
years old, thou shalt see the face of the Son of Man: therefore let
this suffice, and trouble me no more on this matter.' I was left thus,
without being able to decide whether this coming referred to the
beginning of the millennium or to some previous appearing, or whether
I should die and thus see his face. I believe the coming of the Son of
Man will not be any sooner than that time;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 130. 14-17.
</p>
<p>"I have asked of the Lord concerning his coming; and while asking the
Lord, he gave me a sign and said, 'In the days of Noah I set a bow in
the heavens as a sign and token that in any year that the bow should be
seen the Lord would not come; but there should be seed time and harvest
during that year; but whenever you see the bow withdrawn, it shall be a
token that there shall be famine, pestilence, and great distress among
the nations, and that the coming of the Messiah is not far distant.' *
* *
</p>
<p>"I also prophesy, in the name of the Lord, that Christ WILL NOT COME
IN FORTY YEARS; and if God ever spoke by my mouth, he will not come in
that length of time. Brethren, when you go home, write this down, that
it may be remembered. * * * Jesus Christ never did reveal to any man
the precise time that he would come;" <em>His. of J. Smith, March</em> 10,

<a name="scattering"></a><h2>THE SCATTERING OF ISRAEL.
</h2>
<p>During the administration of Moses, the Lord promised Israel,
conditionally, many blessings and curses. The former if they were
obedient to his commandments, the latter if they were rebellious.
These promises were, in their nature, prophetic. Evidently, no man,
unless inspired by the Holy Ghost, as was Moses, could have thought of
blessings and curses so varied and comprehensive in their nature, much
less have spoken and recorded them.
</p>
<p>The subject of the scattering of Israel is historical, and needs to
be well understood, in order to comprehend the great work of their
gathering in the latter times. A moderate comprehension of the
scattering of Israel requires much careful study of their history in
the Old Testament, and as written by that eminent Jewish historian,
Josephus, a general knowledge of history, and of the many prophecies
yet to be fulfilled concerning them.
</p>
<p>If a complete history of the house of Israel were written, it would
be the history of histories, the key of the world's history for the
past twenty centuries. The student is particularly recommended to
study the last chapters of <em>Deuteronomy</em>, from the beginning of the
twenty-seventh to the end of the book.
</p>
<p>The scattering of the seed of Joseph, among all nations, was
foreshadowed in the blessing of his father, Jacob: "Joseph is a
fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well, whose branches run
over the wall;" <em>Gen</em>. 49. 22.
</p>
<p>A terrible prophetic picture of the afflictions which the Lord would
heap upon Israel, is drawn by Moses in the twenty-sixth chapter of
<em>Leviticus</em>. If persistently disobedient, they were to be scattered
among all nations and suffer great afflictions in the lands of their
enemies.
</p>
<p>The prophet Abijah said to the wife of Jeroboam, "The Lord shall smite
Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel
out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall
scatter them beyond the river;" 1 <em>Kings</em> 14. 15. This prophecy was
fulfilled when the ten tribes were carried into captivity by the king
of Assyria 721, B. C.; 2 <em>Kings</em> 17. In the Apocrypha, the prophet
Esdras states that these ten tribes went a year and a half journey into
the north country; 2 <em>Esdras</em> 13. 39-45. That many remained is evident
from <em>verses</em> 48 and 49 of the same chapter.
</p>
<p>The great historian of Israel, Josephus, who wrote nearly 800 years
after the captivity of the ten tribes, corroborates this view of the
subject. Speaking of the return of the Jews under Esdras, he says:
"Many of them took their effects with them, and came to Babylon, as
very desirous of going down to Jerusalem, but then the entire body
of the people of Israel remained in that country, wherefore there
are but two tribes in Asia and Europe subject to the Romans, while
the ten tribes are beyond the Euphrates till now, and are an immense
multitude, and not to be estimated by numbers;" <em>Ant. B</em>. 11. <em>C</em>.
5. Over twenty-six centuries these scattered tribes of Israel, which
Josephus declared, 1800 years ago, were an immense multitude in Asia,
have continued to mix up with the nations of the earth.
</p>
<p>The second great scattering of Israel was brought about by the
Babylonish captivity. The Lord said through the prophet Jeremiah, "I
will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon;" 20. 4. There
is an account of the fulfilment of this prophecy in 2 <em>Kings, chapters</em>
24 and 25. Jerusalem was desolated and only the poor left to till the
land.
</p>
<p>The Jews, like the ten tribes before them, were scattered among the
nations of Asia. In <em>Ezra, Chap</em>. 2, we have an account of those who
returned to build the waste places of Judah, but multitudes of them
remained in their scattered condition, as is evident from the book
of Esther. Some nine years after the completion of the term of their
captivity, they were scattered from India to Ethiopia, through the 127
provinces of the Persian empire; 8. 9.
</p>
<p>Jeremiah prophesied the entire desolation of Judah; "Judah shall
be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away
captive;" 13. 19. It was nearly 600 years from the consummation of the
Babylonish captivity to the fulfilment of this prophecy, by the final
destruction of the Jews, as a nation, by the Romans, when a remnant of
some 97,000 were sold into slavery in the cities of the Roman empire,
and were scattered wherever the caprice of their masters led them.
</p>
<p>During this period, from the Babylonish captivity to the destruction
of Jerusalem, the Jews suffered much from their enemies, and many
thousands were sold into slavery. A few references to Josephus will
assist to comprehend this subject:
</p>
<p><em>Ant. B</em>. 11. <em>C</em>. 5. Miserable condition of the Jews as represented to
the prophet Nehemiah.
</p>
<p><em>B</em>. 11. <em>C</em>. 6. Haman said to the king of Persia, "There is a certain
wicked nation (the Jews), and it is dispersed over all the habitable
earth that is under thy dominion."
</p>
<p><em>B</em>. 12. <em>C</em>. 1. The first Ptolemy took a great many captives in Judea
and carried them into Egypt.
</p>
<p><em>B</em>. 12. <em>C</em>. 2. The second Ptolemy liberated 120,000 Jews who where in
bondage in Egypt.
</p>
<p><em>B</em>. 12. <em>C</em>. 3. Antiochus set free all the Jews who had been carried
captive.
</p>
<p><em>B</em>. 12. <em>C</em>. 4. The Samaritans were in a flourishing condition, and
much distressed the Jews, cutting off parts of their land, and carrying
off slaves.
</p>
<p><em>B</em>. 12. <em>C</em>. 5. The daily sacrifice was taken away, and 10,000 Jews
carried captive.
</p>
<p><em>B</em>. 14. <em>C</em>. 7. The Jews were scattered over the habitable earth.
Cassius, the Roman general, carried 30,000 Jews captive.
</p>
<p><em>B</em>. 14. <em>C</em>. 11. Four Jewish cities sold into slavery for taxes.
</p>
<p><em>B</em>. 15. <em>C</em>. 3. Not a few ten thousands of Jews that dwelt about
Babylonia.
</p>
<p><em>B</em>. 16. <em>C</em>. 2. A great multitude of Jews dwelt in the cities of Ionia.
</p>
<p><em>B</em>. 16. <em>C</em>. 6. The cities of Asia and Lybia ill-treated the Jews. The
northern part of Africa was then called Lybia.
</p>
<p>These references to Josephus, and their contexts, well considered, will
greatly assist the student in forming a proper idea of the scattered
condition of the Jews about the commencement of the Christian era.
</p>
<p>We have no knowledge of the location or condition of that part of the
ten tribes who went into the north country.
</p>
<p>B. C. 600, a colony left Jerusalem, under one Lehi, to people the
western hemisphere. Eleven years after, it was followed by another
under the direction of Mulek. Their descendants have scattered over the
American continent from Cape Horn to the Arctic Sea.
</p>
<p>This branch of the house of Israel may truly be said to be scattered
over half the globe. The Book of Mormon, and the monumental ruins they
have left on the land, give us all the information we have of them down
to the year 1492, A. D., when Christopher Columbus discovered America.
</p>
<p>Since that time, their history forms a part of the general history
of the continent, which is a record of the fulfilment of many of the
prophecies, in the Bible and Book of Mormon, concerning the scattering
of Israel.

<a name="gathering"></a><h2>GATHERING OF ISRAEL.
</h2>
<p>It will appear to the most casual reader, that the Gathering of Israel
is predicated on its having been scattered. That part of the subject
needs to be well studied, to obtain a proper conception of the great
work of gathering in the latter times.
</p>
<p>As general as was the scattering of Israel so must the gathering be. If
the dispersion was over all the earth, and among all nations, so the
gathering must be out of all nations, and from all parts of the earth.
</p>
<p>When we reflect that it is thirty-two centuries since the enemies
of Israel began to oppress them in the land of Canaan, that about
one-third of the time they were a people in that land, they were,
more or less, in bondage to their enemies; that seven hundred years
before the coming of Christ the ten tribes were scattered throughout
western Asia; that we have no record that any have as yet returned to
the land of their inheritance; that nearly 600 years before Christ
the Babylonish captivity took place, and that, according to the Book
of Esther only a part of the Jews ever returned, but were scattered
through the 127 provinces of the Persian empire; that Asia was the
hive from which swarmed the nomadic tribes who overran Europe; that
at the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans the Jews were scattered
over the known world; we may well ask the question, Does not Israel
to-day constitute a large proportion of the human family? With this
comprehensive view of the subject of the scattering, we the better
understand such passages as the following, "I will gather the remnant
of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them;" <em>Jer</em>.
23. 3. "Wherefore, he will bring them again out of captivity, and they
shall be gathered together to the lands of their inheritance; and they
shall be brought out of obscurity, and out of darkness;" 1 <em>Nephi</em> 22.
12.
</p>
<p>Our Savior had a clear conception of the magnitude of this gathering
when he said, "He shall send his angels with a great sound of a
trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds,
from one end of heaven to the other;" <em>Matt</em>. 24. 31.
</p>
<p>"And Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times
of the Gentiles be fulfilled;" <em>Luke</em> 21. 24. That is until the Gentile
rule shall wane before the growing power of Israel, when, "Israel shall
be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation;" <em>Isa</em>. 45. 17.
When "They shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they
shall rule over their oppressors;" 14. 2.
</p>
<p>Then will the promise made to Abraham be fully realized by his
children, "And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;" <em>Gen</em>.
22. 17. Then will Abraham be the heir of the world, "Through the
righteousness of faith;" <em>Rom</em> 4. 13.
</p>
<p>It is evident from the Book of Mormon, that the Jews, as well as
other portions of the house of Israel, will believe in Jesus Christ
and accept the Gospel, before they are gathered to the land of their
inheritance.
</p>
<p>The first Nephi, about 600 years before the final dispersion of the
Jews, recorded the following very comprehensive prophecy about their
gathering: "And after they have been scattered, and the Lord God hath
scourged them by other nations, for the space of many generations, yea,
even down from generation to generation, until they shall be persuaded
to believe in Christ, the Son of God, and the atonement, which is
infinite for all mankind; and when that day shall come, that they shall
believe in Christ, and worship the Father in his name, with pure hearts
and clean hands, and look not forward any more for another Messiah,
then, at that time. The day will come that it must needs be expedient
that they should believe these things, and the Lord will set his hand
again the second time to restore his people from their lost and fallen
state. Wherefore, he will proceed to do a marvellous work and a wonder
among the children of men;" 2 <em>Nephi</em> 25. 15, 16, 17.

<a name="Evidences"></a><h2>BOOK OF MORMON&mdash;EVIDENCES OF ITS DIVINE AUTHENTICITY.
</h2>
<p>In order that the predictions of the ancient prophets might be
fulfilled, it was necessary that a book should be brought forth to the
world which should be a record of truth. This book must also come forth
from the earth.
</p>
<p>The prophet Enoch, according to Bible chronology, lived 969 years
before the flood.
</p>
<p>On a certain occasion, the Lord made known to him many things that
should transpire a short period before his latter-day coming. He said,
"Great tribulation shall be among the children of men, but my people
will I preserve; and righteousness will I send down out of heaven;
and truth will I send forth out of the earth, to bear testimony of
mine Only Begotten; and righteousness and truth will I cause to sweep
the earth as with a flood, to gather out mine own elect from the four
quarters of the earth." <em>P. of G. P., page</em> 21.
</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon, in every particular, fulfils this very ancient
prediction of Enoch's. It is a record of truth; it was brought forth
from the earth; it bears testimony of the Only Begotten Son of God;
of his birth, death, resurrection, teachings, and ministrations among
the Nephites. Righteousness has been sent down out of heaven by the
restoration of the Priesthood, with all its authority, ordinances, and
blessings, through which, alone, righteousness can be made manifest.
</p>
<p>The latter-day gathering of Israel has been inaugurated, and
righteousness, and truth are sweeping the earth as with a flood, and
gathering the elect from the four quarters of the earth.
</p>
<p>This wonderful prophecy of Enoch's was reiterated by prophets who lived
many centuries after him. The Psalmist David, who lived until 1015 B.
C., mentions this event in connection with the latter days: "Truth
shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from
heaven;" <em>Psalms</em> 85. 11.
</p>
<p>The prophet Isaiah, also, saw in prophetic vision these great events of
the latter days, when he said: "Let the skies pour down righteousness;
let the earth open and let them"&mdash;that is, the earth and the skies
together&mdash;"bring forth salvation;" 45. 8.
</p>
<p>According to the twenty-ninth chapter of <em>Isaiah</em>. there was to be a
people who like Ariel, or Jerusalem, were to be brought down and they
should speak out of the ground, their speech was to be low out of the
dust.
</p>
<p>The predictions in <em>verses</em> 1-6 of this chapter have been fulfilled
in every particular, in the history of the Nephites and in the coming
forth of their record, the Book of Mormon.
</p>
<p>For an account of the fulfilment of many of the predictions in this
chapter, see <em>P. of G. P., pages</em> 49-54.
</p>
<p>Ezekiel's prophecy, in <em>chapter</em> 37, <em>verses</em> 16-20, concerning the
sticks of Judah and Joseph, is literally fulfilled in this generation.
The most of the Latter-day Saints are of the tribe of Ephraim, the son
of Joseph. There can be but one conclusion with regard to the Bible,
and that is, that it is the stick of Judah referred to by Ezekiel.
</p>
<p>The stick or record of Joseph, is fitly represented by the Book of
Mormon, which is a record of the Nephites, who are descendants of
Joseph who was sold into Egypt. They are both, to-day, in the hands of
Ephraim.
</p>
<p>A very good explanation of this subject is contained in 2 <em>Nephi,
chapter</em> 3. Lehi was rehearsing to his son Joseph, some important
promises which the Lord made to their father, Joseph, who was sold into
Egypt. The special promise to which we refer is in the twelfth verse.
</p>
<p>"Wherefore, the fruit of thy loins shall write; and the fruit of the
loins of Judah shall write; and that which shall be written by the
fruit of thy loins, and also that which shall be written by the fruit
of the loins of Judah, shall grow together, unto the confounding of
false doctrines, and laying down of contentions, and establishing
peace among the fruit of thy loins, and bringing them to the knowledge
of their fathers in the latter-days; and also to the knowledge of my
covenants, saith the Lord."
</p>
<p>The following from the writings of O. Pratt, is very appropriate to
this subject.
</p>
<p>"If the historical parts of the Book of Mormon be compared with
what little is known from other sources, concerning the history of
ancient America, there will be found much evidence to substantiate its
truth; but there cannot be found one truth among all the gleanings of
antiquity that clashes with the historical truths of the Book of Mormon.
</p>
<p>"If the prophetical part of this wonderful book be compared with
the prophetical declarations of the Bible, there will be found much
evidence in the latter to establish the truth of the former. But though
there are many predictions in the Book of Mormon, relating to the great
events of the last days, which the Bible gives us no information about,
yet there is nothing in the predictions of the Bible that contradicts
in the least, the predictions of the Book of Mormon.
</p>
<p>"If the doctrinal part of the Book of Mormon be compared with the
doctrines of the Bible, there will be found the same perfect harmony
which we find on the comparison of the prophetical parts of the two
books. Although there are many points of the doctrine of Christ that
are far more plain and definite in the Book of Mormon than in the
Bible, and many things revealed in relation to doctrine that never
could be fully learned from the Bible, yet there are not any items of
doctrine in the two sacred books that contradict each other, or clash
in the least.
</p>
<p>"If the various books which enter into the collection, called the Book
of Mormon, be carefully compared with each other, there will be found
nothing contradictory in history, in prophecy, or in doctrine.
</p>
<p>"If the miracles of the Book of Mormon be compared with the miracles of
the Bible, there cannot be found in the former anything that would be
more difficult to believe, than what we find in the latter.
</p>
<p>"If we compare the historical, prophetical, and doctrinal parts of
the Book of Mormon, with the great truths of science and nature, we
find no contradictions&mdash;no absurdities&mdash;nothing unreasonable. The most
perfect harmony, therefore, exists between the great truths revealed
in the Book of Mormon, and all other known truths, whether religious,
historical, or scientific." <em>Divine Authenticity of B. of M., page</em> 56.
</p>
<p>A person educated in the doctrines and traditions of modern
Christianity, could not have written the Book of Mormon, for many of
its important doctrines do not agree with those of the Christian sects.
</p>
<p>They do not believe in the ministry of angels, in miracles, in signs,
in dreams and in visions. The book had its origin in those things, much
of it is made up of an account of them.
</p>
<p>Lehi, the most prominent patriarch of the aboriginal American race, was
warned by an angel that Jerusalem would be destroyed; 1 <em>Nephi</em> 1. 11,
13. That he might not be destroyed with it, the Lord warned him in a
dream to take his family and depart into the wilderness; 2. 2. In the
nineteenth verse of this last chapter, the Lord spake to Nephi, and
blessed him on account of his great faith.
</p>
<p>Nephi, who wrote the first two books of the Book of Mormon, had
wonderful visions and manifestations. An infidel, or deist, having no
faith in manifestations from God, could not have written the book;
equally impossible that it could have been written by a sectarian
Christian.
</p>
<p>Was the Book of Mormon written for a romance? It would spoil the
interest of a work of fiction, for the writer to commence it with a
sketch of the plan of his story. Yet the two books of Nephi, which
commence the Book of Mormon, are a very plain, prophetic sketch of the
then future history of the people of America.
</p>
<p>Besides, what writer of fiction could expect to interest the literary
world of the nineteenth century, with an account of the organization
of a church, on the American continent, exactly after the pattern of
the primitive church in Asia, with advocating baptism by immersion for
the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of
hands, and with an almost verbatim repetition of Christ's sermon on the
Mount. Such a fiction would be wanting in all the elements of modern
romance.
</p>
<p>Skeptics, Christian divines, and writers of romance are not the men to
stake their reputation on the enunciation of such principles as the
following: "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he
that believeth not and is not baptized shall be damned." "Harlotry is
the most abominable of all sins in the sight of God, except it be the
sin against the Holy Ghost." In fact, it is the teaching of such pure
principles in the Book of Mormon that makes it so very unpopular with a
large portion of mankind.
</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon, as a whole, must be either true or false. If false,
the Bible is equally so, for there is no antagonism between the two.
</p>
<p>The former states that it and the Bible shall grow together for the
confounding of false doctrine in the latter times. The writer of a book
of errors would hardly have staked his reputation on the fact that his
book was an evidence of the truth of the Bible, and <em>vice versa</em>. That
one is a witness of the truth of the other is readily evident to any
one who will honestly compare them.
</p>
<p>Written by different authors, under very different circumstances, and
on opposite sides of the globe, such perfect concordance would have
been impossible, unless the authors had all been actuated by the same
Spirit of divine inspiration.
</p>
<p>The admission is general that the Bible was written and compiled on the
Eastern hemisphere, and, more or less continuously through a period
of some 1500 years. The fact is generally recognized that the Book of
Mormon was written on the Western hemisphere, and by those who had
nothing to do in getting up the Bible.
</p>
<p>The chain of history it has recorded; the principles it teaches; its
anomalous style as a literary production, and its truthfulness as a
prophetic record, are all against its being a production of modern
times.
</p>
<p>As an ancient record, it contains many predictions of prophets and
seers which have been realized, and many others which are now having
a remarkable fulfilment. It has these facts in favor of its divine
origin, as well as the Bible.
</p>
<p>Not the least remarkable of its prophecies are those declaring how it
should be written, and why. How it should be hid up in the earth for
many generations, and how it should come forth in the latter times;
every particular of which has been realized.

<a name="bibleprophecies"></a><h2>JOSEPH SMITH, JUN., AS A FULFILLER OF BIBLE PROPHECIES.
</h2>
<p>The mission of Joseph Smith, Jun., is the key of the dispensation of
the fulness of times. If he was not sent of God, the pretentions of the
Latter-day Saints to be the true Gospel church are without foundation,
and their labors for the redemption of the world must prove a failure.
</p>
<p>If, in his life's labors, and their results, the predictions of the
ancient prophets are being fulfilled, it should be satisfactory
evidence of the divinity of his mission. For unless a man have the
spirit of the prophets, he can neither understand their predictions,
nor the nature of the events that would fulfil them.
</p>
<p>John, the Revelator, in his vision of the latter times, saw another
"Angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to
preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and
kindred, and tongue;" <em>Rev</em>. 14. 6.
</p>
<p>On page 49, <em>P. of G. P</em>., Joseph Smith, Jun., states that a glorious
personage appeared to him and said that his name was Moroni. This
angel told Mr. Smith one thing concerning his own future, that, since
that time, 1823, has had a remarkable fulfilment. This was that his
name "should be had for good or evil among all nations, kindreds and
tongues."
</p>
<p>He also informed him that there was a record on gold plates, deposited
in the earth, which gave an account of the ancient inhabitants of this
continent, and of the source from which they sprang.
</p>
<p>A book containing such information, as the angel said, was engraven on
the plates, was produced by Mr. Smith, with competent witnesses that it
was a translation from certain plates of gold which were shown to them
by an angel. (<em>See Book of Mormon for the historical account, and the
third page for the testimony of the witnesses</em>.)
</p>
<p>The angel Moroni further stated, that the record contained the fulness
of the everlasting Gospel. Here we have all the conditions necessary
for the fulfilment of the prophetic vision of St. John, regarding the
restoration of the Gospel in the latter times.
</p>
<p>The angel repeated to Mr. Smith the fifth verse of the last chapter of
Malachi, thus: "Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the
hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful
day of the Lord." In <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>., 110. 13, 14, we find an account of
the fulfilment of this prophecy, by the appearance of Elijah to Mr.
Smith. He stated that he had come in fulfilment of this prediction of
Malachi's.
</p>
<p>The angel Moroni quoted the sixth verse as follows: "And he shall
plant in the hearts of the children, the promises made to the fathers,
and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers; if it
were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming."
"Therefore," said the prophet Elijah to Joseph Smith, "The keys of this
dispensation are committed into your hands."
</p>
<p>After receiving authority from the prophet Elijah, Mr. Smith made it
the business of his life to lay the foundation for accomplishing the
great work committed to him. He has left the world most important
instructions on this subject, in <em>Doc. &amp; Cov. sec</em>. 128.
</p>
<p>After referring to the prophecy of Malachi, he says "It is sufficient
to know, in this case, that the earth will be smitten with a curse,
unless there is a welding link of some kind or other, between the
fathers and the children, upon some subject or other, and behold, what
is that subject? It is baptism for the dead. For we without them cannot
be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect. Neither
can they nor we, be made perfect, without those who have died in the
Gospel also;" <em>verse</em> 18. It is necessary that all things be connected
and welded together in one glorious and complete union, from Adam down
to the present time.
</p>
<p>To accomplish this it is necessary that the hearts of the fathers and
children be turned towards each other, by understanding the promises
made in the Gospel. We have no information that the Christian world
has had any knowledge of these glorious principles for the universal
redemption of man, from the time of the primitive church until they
were revealed through Joseph Smith, Jun.
</p>
<p>In the bringing forth of the Book of Mormon, through the agency of an
angel, we find the fulfilment of <em>Psalm</em> 85. 11, "Truth shall spring
out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven;"
and also of a parallel prophecy of Enoch's, <em>P. of G. P. page</em> 21.
"Righteousness will I send down out of heaven; and truth will I send
forth out of the earth." What for? "To bear testimony of mine Only
Begotten."
</p>
<p>Truth came forth out of the earth, in the Book of Mormon, through the
ministration of the angel Moroni, and righteousness came down out of
heaven through the blessings and ordinances of the holy Priesthood,
as restored to the earth by John the Baptist, when he appeared to J.
Smith, Jun., and O. Cowdery, and conferred upon them the Priesthood of
Aaron, "Which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the
Gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of
sins;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 13.
</p>
<p>And by Peter, James and John, who were sent to Jos. Smith, Jun., and
others, and who ordained them to be apostles and especial witnesses of
Christ. 27. 12. Through these ordinances and blessings came the power
to work righteousness on the earth.
</p>
<p>Here we have all the conditions for the fulfilment of the prophecies
of Enoch and David, through the agency of Mr. Smith. We find, by
comparison, that there is no antagonism in doctrine between the Book
of Mormon and Bible. Christ said, "This Gospel of the kingdom shall
be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then
shall the end come;" <em>Matt</em>. 24. 14.
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, Jun., reiterates this prediction of our Savior's nearly
1800 years after its utterance: "For verily the voice of the Lord is
unto all men;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 1. 2; "And the voice of warning shall be
unto all people;" <em>verse</em> 4. "Wherefore the voice of the Lord is unto
the ends of the earth;" <em>verse</em> 11.
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, Jun., spent the labors of his life, for the
accomplishment of the great work of preaching the Gospel to all the
world, and it has been the great object of the labors of the Latter-day
Saints for more than fifty years. Considering the magnitude of the work
it is being rapidly accomplished.
</p>
<p>Jesus called the Gospel, the "Gospel of the kingdom." Of what kingdom
did he speak, unless of a kingdom of God on the earth which this Gospel
was to establish? Even the kingdom which Daniel speaks of: "And in the
days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which
shall never be destroyed: * * and it shall stand forever;" <em>Dan</em>. 2.
44. "And there was given him (the Son of Man) dominion, and glory, and
a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him;"
7. 14; "And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom
under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the Saints of
the Most High;" <em>verse</em> 27. The kingdom which this Gospel was to build
up, is the great object for which all Latter-day Saints labor.
</p>
<p>One of the great burdens of the ancient prophets was the gathering of
Israel in the latter days, that Jerusalem might be established, and
Zion built up, that the law might go forth from Zion, "And the word of
the Lord from Jerusalem;" <em>Isa</em>. 2. 3.
</p>
<p>It is evident from the tenor of the inspired writings, that this
kingdom is to consist of gathered Israel, and therefore the gathering
of Israel must be a part of "This Gospel of the kingdom." Some one must
receive authority to organize the means for accomplishing this great
gathering of the latter days.
</p>
<p>The former great gatherer and deliverer of Israel was Moses, and he,
very naturally, was the one to restore that authority to the earth
after the fulness of the Gentiles should come in.
</p>
<p>Through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, Jos. Smith, Jun., understood
this, and had the faith to receive the administrations of Moses, and
he has left the fact on record. "And Moses appeared before us, and
committed unto us the keys of the gathering of Israel from the four
parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten tribes from the land of
the north;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 110. 11.
</p>
<p>He preached "This Gospel of the kingdom," the obedient received the
Holy Ghost, and it moved them to gather together, and Israel, for over
fifty years, has been gathering to form that kingdom in fulfilment of
the predictions of the ancient prophets.
</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, Jun., is the first man of whom we have any record, for
some 1800 years, that has labored for the fulfilment of the predictions
of the ancient prophets; <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 1. 18.
</p>
<p>The Lord said, through his prophet Micah, "In the last days it shall
come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be
established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above
the hills; * * and many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let
us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of
Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths:
for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from
Jerusalem;" <em>Mic</em>. 4. 1, 2.
</p>
<p>For many years there has been a "House of the Lord" in Salt Lake City,
in the top of the mountains, and for more than thirty years, the
people of many nations have been saying, "Come and let us go up to the
mountain of the Lord."
</p>
<p>That there will be a place called Zion from which "The law shall go
forth," distinct from Jerusalem, is evident from Isaiah, "When the Lord
of Hosts shall reign in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem;" 24. 23.
</p>
<p>How is it that Joseph Smith, Jun., first organized the means for the
partial fulfilment of this prophecy, and left, at his death, the
authority and instructions necessary to complete its fulfilment, by the
building of a great city to be called Zion, in the state of Missouri,
which in fulfilment of the prophecy, shall become the capital of this
western hemisphere, if he did not obtain his knowledge of the whole
matter through Divine inspiration?
</p>
<p>The Jaredite prophet, Ether, some 2500 years ago, foretold "That a New
Jerusalem should be built up upon this land (America), unto the seed of
Joseph;" <em>Ether</em> 13. 4, 6.
</p>
<p>There is a wonderful connection between this passage in the Book of
Mormon, and the prophecies of Isaiah and Micah, the result of one
spirit of inspiration, acting upon different men, in countries, long
distances apart, and at different periods of time.
</p>
<p>It is quite as unaccountable on any other grounds than that of
inspiration, that Joseph Smith, Jun., after many centuries had elapsed
since these predictions of the prophets, should declare to the world
that the time was at hand for their fulfilment, and that he should have
the confidence to indicate the identical spot, on this great land of
North America, where this city of Zion is to be built. "This is the
land of promise, and the place for the city of Zion. * * * Behold, the
place which is now called Independence, is the center place, and a spot
for the temple is lying westward;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 57. 2, 3.
</p>


<a name="bomprophecies"></a><h2>JOSEPH SMITH AS A FULFILLER OF BOOK OF MORMON PROPHECIES.
</h2>
<p>The first Nephi, 2400 years before the days of Joseph Smith, the
Prophet, had a vision of the discovery and colonization of America by
Europeans. He also saw the record of the Jews (the Bible) come forth
from the Gentiles to the remnant of the seed of his brethren (the
American Indians). He says, "After it had come forth unto them, I
beheld other books, which came forth by the power of the Lamb, from the
Gentiles unto them:" 1 <em>Nephi</em> 13. 38, 39.
</p>
<p>Admitting that this prophecy has been partly fulfilled, by Christian
denominations who have sent missionaries and the Bible among the
Indians, it remained for Joseph Smith, Jun., to initiate the fulfilment
of the second part of the prophecy, that other books, besides the
Bible, should come forth to the children of Lehi, which should bear
testimony of the truth of the Bible.
</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon was the first of this series of books, which were
to be carried forth among the American Indians, after the Bible. It
has been followed by the book of Doctrine and Covenants, containing
revelations and instructions concerning the latter-day work, and by
inspired translations from the writings of Enoch, Abraham and Moses,
which all bear record of the truth of the Jewish prophets, and of the
teachings of Jesus and his apostles, as foretold they would do by the
prophet Nephi.
</p>
<p>This same prophet further says, "There is nothing which is secret, save
it shall be revealed; * * * there is nothing which is sealed upon the
earth, save it shall be loosed. Wherefore, all things which have been
revealed unto the children of men, shall at that day be revealed;" 2
<em>Nephi</em> 30. 17, 18. The context of this passage shows that it speaks of
the latter days.
</p>
<p>The following is nearly a parallel passage in meaning: "And he shall
send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you: whom the heaven
must receive until the times of restitution of <em>all things</em>, which God
hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets <em>since the world
began</em>;" <em>Acts</em> 3. 20, 21.
</p>
<p>That is, all the knowledge that has ever been revealed to man will
be restored to the earth. All that was revealed to Adam and the
ante-diluvian prophets; to Noah and the Jaredite prophets; to Abraham;
to Moses and the Jewish prophets; to the Nephite prophets; to the
primitive apostles of our Savior, and many others, to whom the Lord has
shewn all things from the beginning of the world to the end thereof.
</p>
<p>After many centuries had passed, in which man's wisdom had failed to
comprehend the meaning of the phrase, "The restitution of all things,"
or the grand fulfilment of prophecy comprehended in a "Dispensation
of the fulness of times"&mdash;a time in which all the knowledge and power
of all times will be gathered into one&mdash;Jos. Smith, Jun., appears in
the United States of America, and claims that the Lord has authorized
him to open up this grand dispensation of a fulness, and that for this
purpose he has bestowed upon him first, and then through him upon
others, all the keys and powers of the Priesthood which had been held
in former dispensations.
</p>
<p>"For unto you, (the twelve) and those (the first presidency) who
are appointed with you, to be your counselors and your leaders, is
the power of this Priesthood given, for the last days and for the
last time, in the which is the dispensation of the fulness of times,
which power you hold in connection with all those who have received a
dispensation at any time from the beginning of creation;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>.
112. 30-32.
</p>
<p>In <em>sec</em>. 110 we are informed that Jesus Christ, Elias, Moses, and
Elijah the prophet, appeared to Jos. Smith, Jun., and others, and
bestowed upon them the keys of the holy Priesthood, held in other
dispensations, that they might be concentrated in this.
</p>
<p>In these last two quotations, from <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>., we have an account of
the bestowal of the necessary authority upon certain persons, for the
opening up of the gathering dispensation of the latter times, that is
perfectly consistent with the Book of Mormon and the Bible.
</p>
<p>No man, unless endowed by Divine inspiration, could have conceived of
such a sacramental feast as is represented in the following, to which
will be gathered in the latter times, the great dignitaries of all
dispensations, with Jesus Christ at their head, together holding all
the keys, authority and powers of the holy Priesthood, pertaining to
the redemption of man and of the earth.
</p>
<p>"For the hour cometh that I will drink of the fruit of the vine with
you on the earth, and with Moroni, whom I have sent unto you to reveal
the Book of Mormon, containing the fulness of my everlasting Gospel, *
* * and also with Elias, to whom I have committed the keys of bringing
to pass the restoration of all things," and with John the Baptist,
"whom I have sent unto you, my servants, Jos. Smith, Jun., and Oliver
Cowdery, to ordain you unto this first Priesthood which you have
received. * *
</p>
<p>"And also Elijah, unto whom I have committed the keys of the power
of turning the hearts of the fathers to the children, * * * and also
with Joseph and Jacob, and Isaac, and Abraham, your fathers, * * and
also with Michael, or Adam, the father of all, the prince of all, the
ancient of days.
</p>
<p>"And also with Peter, and James, and John, * * * by whom I have
ordained you and confirmed you to be Apostles, and especial witnesses
of my name, and bear the keys of your ministry, and of the same things
which I have revealed unto them: unto whom I have committed the keys of
my kingdom, and a dispensation of the Gospel for the last times; and
for the fulness of times, in the which I will gather together in one
all things, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth;" 27. 5-13.
</p>
<p>On a certain occasion, when the Nephite disciples of our Savior were
engaged "in mighty prayer and fasting," he appeared in their midst and
asked them, "What will ye that I shall give unto you? And they said
unto him, Lord, we will that thou wouldst tell us the name whereby we
shall call this church; for there are disputations among the people
concerning this matter.
</p>
<p>"And the Lord said unto them, Verily, verily I say unto you, why is it
that the people should murmur and dispute because of this thing? Have
they not read the scriptures, which say ye must take upon you the name
of Christ, which is my name? For by this name shall ye be called at the
last day. * * * Therefore whatsoever ye shall do, ye shall do it in my
name; therefore ye shall call the church in my name;" 3 <em>Nephi</em> 27. 2-7.
</p>
<p>In the above Jesus plainly told his disciples that his name was Christ,
and that his church should be called Christ's Church, not Christian,
Catholic, Campbellite or Episcopalian.
</p>
<p>When Jos. Smith, Jun., organized this church, on the 6th of April,
1830, it was organized as the Church of Jesus Christ, in obedience to
the instructions of Jesus Christ, some 1800 years before.
</p>
<p>The prophet Nephi, speaking of the gathering of Israel, says, that
the Lord "Will bring them again out of captivity, and they shall be
gathered together to the lands of their inheritance; and they shall be
brought out of obscurity, and out of darkness;" 1 <em>Nephi</em> 22. 12.
</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon, brought forth through the agency of Jos. Smith,
Jun., reveals to the world the fact that the millions of aboriginal
Americans scattered over the American continent, from Cape Horn to the
Arctic Ocean, are of the house of Israel.
</p>
<p>The keys of the Patriarchal Priesthood enable those on whom they are
bestowed, to know, by revelation, the lineage of the Latter-day Saints,
and tens of thousands of Ephraim, and thousands of Manasseh, are being
gathered, who were not known before the days of Jos. Smith, Jun., as
portions of the house of Israel. Thus the great work of bringing the
tribes of Israel, out of obscurity and darkness, and of developing
their existence to themselves, and to the world, has been inaugurated
by Jos. Smith, Jun. The work must continue until they are gathered from
all parts of the earth, in fulfilment of the words of the prophets, and
of the promises made to their fathers.
</p>
<p>The following promise was made to Joseph who was sold into Egypt,
"The fruit of thy loins shall write; and the fruit of the loins of
Judah shall write;" and that which shall be written, "Shall grow
together, unto the confounding of false doctrines, and laying down of
contentions, and establishing peace among the fruit of thy loins, and
bringing them to the knowledge of their fathers in the latter-days; and
also the knowledge of my covenants, saith the Lord;" 2 <em>Nephi</em> 3. 12.
Jos. Smith, Jun., has brought forth the Book of Mormon, the writing of
the fruit of the loins of Joseph through Ephraim and Manasseh, and has
placed it, side by side, with the writing of the fruit of the loins of
Judah&mdash;the Bible&mdash;the one establishing the truth of the other, and thus
has literally fulfilled this prophecy.
</p>
<p>The Lord further said to Joseph who was sold into Egypt, "I will raise
up unto the fruit of thy loins; and I will make for him a spokesman.
And I, behold, I will give unto him, that he shall write the writing of
the fruit of thy loins (the Nephites), unto the fruit of thy loins (the
American Indians); and the spokesman of thy loins shall declare it;"
<em>verse</em> 18.
</p>
<p>In <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>., we are informed of the fulfilment of this prophecy.
The Lord said to Joseph the prophet and S. Rigdon, "It is expedient
in me that you, my servant Sidney, should be a spokesman unto this
people; yea, verily, I will ordain you unto this calling, even to be a
spokesman unto my servant Joseph;" 100. 9.
</p>
<p>"And it shall be as if the fruit of thy loins had cried unto them
from the dust;" 2 <em>Nephi</em> 3. 19. Jos. Smith, Jun., was of the lineage
of Joseph who was sold into Egypt, to whom these promises were made.
The Nephites were also his descendants, and they wrote and hid up the
plates of the Book of Mormon, with the assurance that, in after years,
the writing should be brought forth to their descendants and others
of the house of Israel; <em>Mormon</em> 8. 14-16. The record was engraved on
plates in a language known only to the Nephites; <em>Mormon</em> 9. 34.
</p>
<p>Of necessity there were some means provided for interpreting and
re-writing the record in a modern language, before it could benefit
those for whom it was designed. With the plates of the Book of Mormon
was found a Urim and Thummim, by means of which, through the power of
God, Jos. Smith, Jun., was enabled to translate the Nephite record for
the benefit of the descendants of Lehi, and any others of the human
family who would receive it; <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 10. 1. "And it shall be
as if the fruit of thy loins had cried to them from the dust," was
fulfilled in taking the writing out of the earth, where it had been
deposited for 1400 years.
</p>
<p>In <em>Mormon</em> 8. 13, 14, we are informed that the record was hid up in
the earth by Moroni, the son of Mormon, and it remained under his care
until he delivered it to Joseph Smith, Jun., <em>P. of G. P. page</em> 49.
The Lord said, "And it shall come to pass that my people which are of
the house of Israel, shall be gathered home unto the lands of their
possessions; and my word also shall be gathered in one;" 2 <em>Nephi</em> 29.
14.
</p>
<p>In fulfilment of this prophecy, Jos. Smith, Jun., during the short
period of his ministry, not only inaugurated the great work of
gathering Israel, but also of gathering together sacred writings, which
at this time consist of the unsealed portion of the record of Mormon;
the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, and of important portions of the
writings of Enoch, of Abraham, and of Moses. He also declared that more
sacred writings would come forth, as fast as the people were prepared
to receive them.
</p>
<p>Moroni, who completed and hid up the record of Mormon in the earth,
says, of the plates, "Unto three shall they be shown by the power of
God; wherefore they shall know of a surety that these things are true.
And in the mouth of three witnesses shall these things be established;"
<em>Ether</em> 5. 3, 4. We find that the Lord repeated this prediction to Jos.
Smith, Jun.; <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 5. 11-15. On the second page, after the
title page of the Book of Mormon, we find the testimony of three men,
Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer and Martin Harris, that an angel appeared
to them and showed them the plates, "Which is a record of the people of
Nephi, and also of the Lamanites their brethren, and also of the people
of Jared, who came from the tower" of Babel.
</p>
<p>It was made manifest to them that they had been translated by the gift
and power of God, and the voice of the Lord commanded that they should
bear record of the things that had been shown them.
</p>


<a name="ownprophecies"></a><h2>JOSEPH SMITH, JUN., AS A PROPHET, AND FULFILLER OF HIS OWN PROPHECIES.
</h2>
<p>"And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of
my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>.
1. 4. This was one of the first prophetic commandments given to the
Latter-day Saints, through Jos. Smith, Jun.
</p>
<p>Many hundreds of the Elders of the Church have traveled to and fro in
the earth, regardless of exposure to the elements, of fatigue, or of
pecuniary considerations, warning the people to repent of their sins,
for the day of the Lord was near.
</p>
<p>There are now but few nations who are prepared to receive the word,
that have not had the Gospel of this dispensation preached to them.
With a constantly increasing number of Elders, the labor will continue
until the Gospel is preached "as a witness to all nations." The quorums
of the Priesthood were organized and set in order, by Jos. Smith, Jun.,
with this great work especially in view.
</p>
<p>In <em>sec</em>. 3. 16-20, it is predicted that a knowledge of the Savior,
and also of their fathers, should come to the descendants of Lehi, the
American Indians. Through the ministry and teachings of Jos. Smith,
Jun., thousands of the Lamanites have come to a knowledge of their
fathers, and many "Believe the Gospel and rely upon the merits of Jesus
Christ," of which many of the Latter-day Saints are witnesses.
</p>
<p>"Behold, a marvellous work is about to come forth among the children
of men;" 4. 1. This declaration was made in February, 1829; before
the organization of the Church. The organization of the Church, the
teachings, unity, energy, and progress of the Latter-day Saints, have
ever been a marvel to the world, and are daily becoming more so, in
fulfilment of this often repeated prediction in the book of <em>Doc. &amp;
Cov</em>.
</p>
<p>In March, 1829, the Lord said to Jos. Smith, Jun., "For hereafter you
shall be ordained and go forth and deliver my words unto the children
of men;" 5. 6. On the 15th of May following, John the Baptist laid
his hands upon the heads of Jos. Smith, Jun., and O. Cowdery, and
ordained them to "The Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the
ministering of angels, and of the Gospel of repentance, and of baptism
by immersion for the remission of sins;" <em>sec</em>. 13.
</p>
<p>It is evident that, previous to this time, Jos. Smith, Jun., had
foreseen by the spirit of prophecy, that it was necessary he should be
called of God as was Aaron, and for this reason was prepared to receive
a proper ordination by the hands of an authorized messenger from God.
We have no record of such previous ordination to the Priesthood, since
the days of the primitive apostles.
</p>
<p>The Lord said to Joseph Smith, Jun., "There are many that lie in wait
to destroy thee from off the face of the earth;" 5. 33. The whole
life of Jos. Smith, Jun., and his death, evidence the truthfulness of
this prophecy. Some forty times was he brought before the courts by
his enemies, and they failed to substantiate the charges preferred
against him, and, on the 27th of June, 1844, he, and his brother Hyrum,
were assassinated in Carthage jail, by a mob, when under the pledged
protection of the Executive of the state of Illinois.
</p>
<p>"And the poor and the meek shall have the Gospel preached unto them,
and they shall be looking forth for the time of my coming;" 35. 15. Not
only has the Gospel been preached to the poor and the meek, but they
are the ones who have received it, and are looking and preparing for
the coming of our Lord, "For it is nigh at hand."
</p>
<p>"Inasmuch as my people shall assemble themselves to the (state of)
Ohio, I have kept in store a blessing such as is not known among the
children of men, and it shall be poured forth upon their heads;" 39.
15. This prophetic promise was given through Joseph Smith, Jun., in
Fayette, New York, January 5, 1831. In 1836, a temple was completed in
the town of Kirtland, Ohio. It was the first temple of modern times,
dedicated to that Priesthood of which Jesus Christ is the acknowledged
head.
</p>
<p>In this temple the Elders of the Church received endowments and great
blessings, of which the world generally were entirely ignorant. The
Lord said through J. Smith, Jun., "The sound must go forth from
this place into all the world, and unto the uttermost parts of the
earth&mdash;the Gospel must be preached unto every creature, with signs
following them that believe;" 58. 64.
</p>
<p>This prophecy was literally fulfilled by the Elders scattering from
Kirtland, after receiving their endowments, to all parts of the United
States and the Canadas, and by the first European Mission being
established soon after.
</p>
<p>At this time thousands of Latter-day Saints can testify that the Gospel
has been preached in a large portion of the world, and that the signs
of faith, gift of tongues, healing, etc., have followed the believer.
</p>
<p>The following remarkable prophecy was delivered Dec. 25th, 1832. "Thus
saith the Lord, concerning the wars that will shortly come to pass,
beginning at the rebellion of South Carolina, which will eventually
terminate in the death and misery of many souls. The days will come
that war will be poured out upon all nations, beginning at that place;
* * and it shall come to pass, after many days, slaves shall rise up
against their masters, who shall be marshalled and disciplined for war;"
</p>
<p>In 1861, twenty-nine years after this prophecy was recorded, the war
between the North and South commenced in South Carolina. It continued
for several years and was very destructive. In the latter part of it
many thousands of slaves deserted their masters and were marshalled and
disciplined for war, and formed a part of the armies of the Northern
States.
</p>
<p>During the contest the Southern States called upon the nation of
Great Britain for assistance. "And it shall come to pass also, that
the remnants who are left of the land (the Indians) will marshal
themselves, and shall become exceeding angry, and shall vex the
Gentiles with a sore vexation;" <em>Sec</em>. 87.
</p>
<p>Never before, since the United States have been a nation, has the
Indian question been so complicated and vexatious as now. That a part
of this prophecy has been so literally fulfilled would seem a guarantee
that the whole will be realized.
</p>
<p>The delivery of the keys of the holy Priesthood unto the Prophet
Joseph Smith, by Elias, by Moses, by Elijah, their ordination to the
Priesthood of Aaron by John the Baptist, to the Melchisedek Priesthood
by Peter, James and John, the building of temples, the ordinances and
endowments for the living and for the dead, received in them; the
preaching of the Gospel to all the world, the gathering of Israel; and
all the varied labors of the Latter-day Saints in order to establish a
veritable kingdom of God on the earth, and to prepare for the coming of
our Savior in his glory, are the direct results of the personal labors
and inspired teachings of Joseph Smith, Jun.
</p>
<p>He stands forth, pre-eminently, as the Divinely inspired prophetic
leader of the "Dispensation of the fulness of times;" as God's agent
for the "Restitution of all things spoken by all holy prophets since
the world began." As the great fulfiller of numerous prophecies of both
the ancient Jewish and Nephite prophets, as recorded in the Bible and
Book of Mormon; as the great prophet of the nineteenth century, and the
fulfiller of his own prophecies, showing that he was Divinely inspired
to both prophesy and to fulfil.

<a name="divineinstitution"></a><h2>MARRIAGE&mdash;A DIVINE INSTITUTION, AND DESIGNED TO BE ETERNAL.
</h2>
<p>Marriage is ordained of God unto man, that the earth might answer the
end of its creation, and "Be filled with the measure of man, according
to his creation before the world was made;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 49. 15-17.
</p>
<p>Outside of marriage the salvation of man would be incomplete: "Neither
is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in
the Lord;" 1 <em>Cor</em>. 11. 11. All the works of God receive the impress
of eternity: "I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be forever:
nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it;" <em>Eccl</em>. 3. 14.
</p>
<p>When the Creator joined Adam and Eve together, as the progenitors
of the human race, we do not learn that he set any limit to the
continuance of their marriage relations. We have no reason to doubt
that the gift of Eve, to Adam, was designed to be as eternal as himself.
</p>
<p>Man, in his fulness, is a twofold organization&mdash;male and female. Either
being incapable of filling the measure of their creation alone, it
requires the union of the two to complete man in the image of God, for
in <em>Gen</em>. 1. 27, it expressly says, that he was created male and female
in the image of God. Therefore, without the proper union of the sexes,
man would be less than what God created him.
</p>
<p>There is a comprehensive significance in, "The Lord God said, it is
not good that the man should be alone;" <em>Gen</em>. 2. 18. It speaks of no
particular period of man's life, and has no limit in its application.
The entire narrative of the union of Adam and Eve, in the second
chapter of Genesis, intimates the designed inseparable relationship
between man and wife, in marriage as ordained of God.
</p>
<p>Adam said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh;" 2.
23. He evidently well understood this eternal relationship with Eve,
when he answered the Lord's question, "Hast thou eaten of the tree,
whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?" and he replied,
"The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and
I did eat;" <em>Gen</em>. 3. 11, 12.
</p>
<p>Here Adam tells the Lord, by way of apology, that in order to keep
his commandment, that he and the woman should remain together, he
was compelled to partake of the forbidden fruit after her. This is
evidently the view the apostle Paul took of the subject: "Adam was not
deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression;" 1
<em>Tim</em>. 2. 14.
</p>
<p>This inseparable connection between man and wife, in marriage as
ordained of God, is further exemplified by the same apostle in <em>Eph</em>.
5. 22-33: "The husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the
head of the church." That is, as Christ is eternally the head of the
church, so is the husband eternally the head of the wife. "Husbands,
love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church. * * so ought men
to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth
himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh. * * Let every one of
you in particular so love his wife even as himself."
</p>
<p>The principle of inseparable connection is fully expressed in Adam's
answer to the Lord as rendered in the writings of Moses, translated by
Joseph, the Seer. "The woman whom thou gavest me, and commanded that
she should remain with me, she gave me of the fruit of the tree and I
did eat;" <em>P. of G. P., page</em> 8.
</p>
<p>We further read, on <em>page</em> 13, "In the day that God created man, (in
the likeness of God made he him), in the image of his own body, male
and female, created he them, and blessed them, and called their name
Adam." Here we are informed that it required the male and female,
united, to make one image of his own body, and that male and female
were necessary to form one Adam, who was in the dual image of God
his father. We also find by referring again to <em>Gen</em>. 1. 27, that it
required the male and female to make an image of God.
</p>
<p>The Lord has ever manifested a great interest in the marriage
relations of his chosen people and Priesthood, and has protected the
sexual relations by stringent laws and regulations. The importance
of marrying in the same lineage, as themselves, appears to have been
well understood by the patriarchs. For this reason, doubtless, Abraham
married a near relation, and sent his servant, Eliezer, to his kindred
to obtain a wife for his son, and heir, Isaac; <em>Gen</em>. 20. 12. <em>Chap</em>.
24.
</p>
<p>Isaac also commanded Jacob to go to Padanaram, and take one of his
cousins to wife; <em>Gen</em>. 28. 1-6. Twice the Lord interfered, in a
miraculous manner, to prevent the wife of Abraham from being defiled;
<em>Gen</em>. 12. 17-20. <em>Chap</em>. 20. 2, 3. Evidently for the reason that she
was the foreordained covenant wife of Abraham, and destined mother
of the Lord's chosen people. Israel was forbidden to marry with the
Canaanites; <em>Deut</em>. 7. 3.
</p>
<p>The Lord gave special commandments regarding the marriage of priests
and their families. A priest's daughter that profaned herself was to be
burned with fire; <em>Lev</em>. 21. 9. The High Priest was required to take a
virgin of his own people to wife; <em>verse</em> 14. The sons of Aaron were
commanded not to take a wife that was a whore, or profane, or a woman
put away from her husband; <em>verse</em> 7.
</p>
<p>"If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they
shall both of them die;" <em>Deut</em>. 22. 22. If a man lay with a virgin, in
the city, that was betrothed to an husband, they were both stoned to
death; <em>verses</em> 23, 24. If a man lay with a virgin not betrothed, and
thereby humbled her, he was required to pay her father fifty shekels of
silver, and take her to wife, without the possibility of divorcing her;
<em>verse</em> 28, 29.
</p>
<p>The eighteenth chapter of Leviticus is chiefly occupied with forbidding
the unlawful indulgence of the passions. The Nephite prophet, Alma,
told his son that harlotry was "most abominable above all sins, save
it be the shedding of innocent blood;" <em>Alma</em> 39, 5. Jesus told his
Nephite disciples "It is better that ye should deny yourselves of these
things, wherein ye will take up your cross, than that ye should be cast
into hell;" 3 <em>Nephi</em> 12. 30.
</p>
<p>In <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>., the passages are numerous in which adultery is
forbidden. The Lord has given much instruction to the Latter-day Saints
concerning the intercourse of the sexes. They are required to keep
themselves strictly within their marriage covenants.
</p>
<p>From the sacred writings, it would appear that in all dispensations of
the Priesthood, the laws regulating this matter have been substantially
the same, and have been calculated to strictly guard the issues of
life; that all those who would keep them might be "perfect in their
generations."
</p>
<p>If, on the one hand, what the Lord does is eternal, because he is an
eternal and infinite being, then what man does of himself, he being
finite, must be limited to this life. Therefore, it is necessary that
man and wife, to be eternally united, should be married in the way God
has appointed, and by a man whom he has authorized to act in his stead.
</p>
<p>It would not be consistent with the character of God, as the spiritual
and natural father of mankind, to have no law regulating the marriages
of his children, that they might be crowned with the blessings of
eternal life and increase.
</p>
<p>The Lord brought Abraham forth abroad, "And said, Look now toward
heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said
unto him, So shall thy seed be;" <em>Gen</em>. 15. 5. This was a promise of
infinite and eternal increase. If we could count the stars, and grasp
infinitude, we might comprehend the result of the promise.
</p>
<p>We find that the Lord confirmed blessings to Abraham, and to his seed,
by recorded ordinance and covenant. For this reason it is not probable
that a blessing of such magnitude, as the sealing upon man and wife the
power of eternal increase, is an exception. Abraham, in his own record,
translated by Joseph the Seer, says, "I sought for the blessings of the
fathers, and the right whereunto I should be ordained to administer the
same." One of these blessings was, "To be a father of many nations, a
prince of peace;" <em>P. of G. P., page</em> 26.
</p>
<p>Abraham understood that this right could only be bestowed by
ordination, by one of the fathers who had received it from the fathers
in regular descent from Adam. He states that this right was conferred
upon him from the fathers, according to his desire. That this right
included the authority to regulate the marriage relations, in the
future generations of his children, is evident from the further
statement, "I sought for mine appointment unto the Priesthood according
to the appointment of God unto the fathers concerning the seed." That
is, he sought for that especial authority in the Priesthood, through
which he had obtained the power of eternal increase.
</p>
<p>The priest's office was bestowed upon Aaron and his posterity forever,
by ordinance and covenant; <em>Exodus</em> 40. 15. Could this have been the
case unless his posterity was made an eternal heritage through the
everlasting covenant of marriage? This power of uniting husband and
wife by an everlasting covenant of marriage, and by that ordinance
giving them an eternal right over their posterity, descended from
Abraham through the fathers, until Israel, by transgression, forfeited
the blessing.
</p>
<p>From the sharpness with which the prophet Nathan reproved David, and
the statement that the Lord had given him the wives of his master Saul;
2 <em>Sam</em>. 12. 1-12, it is probable that the prophet held this authority.
</p>
<p>The great sin of David, apart from the murder of Uriah, was, that he
had taken from another man that which the Lord had given him, and
stepped outside of his own covenant limits.
</p>
<p>Whether the prophet Malachi held the keys of this power or not, he
evidently saw in prophetic vision, that it would be taken from the
earth, and be restored again, that the broken links of past generations
might be welded together. For the Lord said, through him, "I will send
you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful
day of the Lord: and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the
children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come
and smite the earth with a curse;" 4. 5, 6. Or as it is rendered in <em>P.
of G. P., page</em> 50, "And he shall plant in the hearts of the children,
the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall
turn to their fathers; if it were not so, the whole earth would be
utterly wasted at his coming."
</p>
<p>Evidently a very important part of these promises was, that the
children would open up the way of salvation to the fathers, through the
ordinances of the Gospel, and through them the broken links of past
generations would be connected.
</p>
<p>Centuries of darkness passed away in which we hear nothing of the order
of the holy Priesthood, or of any saving ordinances for the dead, when
an obscure man, Joseph Smith, Jun., appeared in the United States of
America, and claimed that to him was committed the authority to open
up the Dispensation of the fulness of times, in which all the keys and
powers of the holy Priesthood should be restored to the earth.
</p>
<p>He professed to be a fulfiller of prophecy, and numerous facts, which
have become a part of history, prove him to be what he professed.
He asserts that in the temple in Kirtland, Ohio, Elias appeared and
committed the dispensation of the "Gospel of Abraham," "Saying, that in
us, and our seed, all generations after us should be blest." In this
we see the needed preparatory work for sealing, upon men the power of
eternal lives, through the everlasting covenant of marriage, through
which Abraham sought "To be a father of many nations."
</p>
<p>Then at the same place appeared Elijah, and said, "Behold, the time has
fully come, which was spoken of by the mouth of Malachi, testifying
that he (Elijah) should be sent before the great and dreadful day of
the Lord come, To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and
the children to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a
curse. Therefore the keys of this dispensation are committed into your
hands;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 110. 11-16. Thus we see that the way has been
opened for the complete reunion and salvation of all the generations or
men, through the keys of the Holy Priesthood which have been bestowed
upon Joseph Smith, Jun. This is the designed glorious culmination of
the New and Everlasting Covenant of Marriage&mdash;the eternal union of the
generations of the righteous in bonds never to be broken.
</p>
<p>In <em>Doc. &amp; Cov. sec</em>. 128. Joseph, the Seer, gives instructions for
restoring the past; in <em>sec</em>. 132, he tells the world how future
generations may come forth in unbroken succession, each succeeding
intelligence, the heritage of its fathers, worlds without end.

<p>Plural marriage is a very ancient institution. Although generally
ignored by peoples professing modern Christianity, it is still
customary among a large portion of the family of man. Many customs of
modern Europe and America are modeled after those of pagan Greece and
Rome, instead of after the primitive patriarchs, or after the examples
recorded in the history of ancient Israel.
</p>
<p>While these ancient nations were monogamists, the limits of intercourse
between the sexes, especially on the part of men, were very indefinite.
This phase of society is quite characteristic of the modern nations of
Europe and America. While the Christian sects of to-day profess some
respect for the patriarchs of Israel, they practically condemn their
family relations as corrupt and immoral.
</p>
<p>If plural marriage be unlawful, then is the whole plan of salvation,
through the house of Israel, a failure, and the entire fabric of
Christianity without foundation.
</p>
<p>God said to Abraham, "I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be
thou perfect. And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will
multiply thee exceedingly. And Abram fell on his face: and God talked
with him, saying, as for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou
shalt be a father of many nations;" <em>Gen</em>. 17. 1-4.
</p>
<p>Here we are informed that God talked with Abraham, told him to be
perfect, bestowed upon him the blessings of a numerous posterity, and,
as a sequence, future power and glory. If polygamy was contrary to
his law, it is remarkable that God should have condescended to talk
with and greatly bless a man who had, but a short time before, taken
a second wife, while the first was living; a fact of which we are
informed in the second and third verses of the previous chapter. If
this was criminal, Sarai, the mother of all Israel, was involved in the
transgression, for she gave Hagar to her husband for a wife; <em>Gen</em>. 16.
3.
</p>
<p>The Lord told Joseph, the Seer, that he commanded, "And Sarah gave
Hagar to Abraham to wife;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 132. 34. This is also the
testimony of Josephus, the Jewish historian; <em>Ant</em>. B. 1. C. 10.
</p>
<p>When Hagar was in distress, on account of difficulty with her mistress,
the Lord did not treat her as a profane, cast off woman, but sent an
angel to counsel and comfort her, by assuring her that her posterity
should not be numbered for multitude; <em>Gen</em>. 16. 8-10.
</p>
<p>The Lord further promised to bless Ishmael, the fruit of this polygamic
marriage, and said, "I will make him fruitful, and will multiply him
exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget and I will make him a great
nation;" 17. 20.
</p>
<p>We find that this great and good man, Abraham, whom the Lord especially
favored, had concubines: for "Unto the sons of the concubines, which
Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his
son;" 25. 6.
</p>
<p>Jacob, the grandson and heir to all the blessings of Abraham, was a
polygamist. He served seven years for Rachel the daughter of Laban,
but being deceived, and Leah given him instead, he served other seven
years for Rachel. Each of these wives had a handmaid, which they gave
to their husband for wives; <em>Gen</em>. 29. 18-35. <em>Chap</em>. 30. 3-12.
</p>
<p>Moses was conversant with the Lord, and was the great lawgiver of
Israel; in his laws especial provision was made for polygamous
children; <em>Deut</em>. 21. 15-17. In them polygamy is not mentioned as one
of the crimes for which penalties were provided.
</p>
<p>Elkanah was a polygamist, yet his son, Samuel, was a great prophet, and
judge in Israel. He was born, and lived under the special favor of God.
</p>
<p>David, king of Israel, was the chosen of the Lord; 1 <em>Sam</em>. 16. 12,
13. He took Abigail and Ahinoam, "And they were also both of them his
wives;" 1 <em>Sam</em>. 25. 42, 43. He "Took him more concubines and wives out
of Jerusalem;" 2 <em>Sam</em>. 5. 13.
</p>
<p>We are further informed, that "David did that which was right in the
eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from anything that he commanded
him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the
Hittite;" 1 <em>Kings</em> 15. 5. In this passage we have an assurance that
David did right in taking all his wives and concubines, except in
one instance, for which he was severely chastised. When Nathan, the
prophet, reproved him for this sin, he said to him, in the name of the
Lord, "I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy
bosom;" 2 <em>Sam</em>. 12. 8.
</p>
<p>After having repented and suffered for his sin, Bath-sheba was given
him for a wife, and she bare Solomon; <em>verse</em> 24. The Lord appeared
to this son of a plural wife in a dream, and bestowed upon him great
blessings; 1 <em>Kings</em> 3. God gave him "Wisdom and understanding
exceeding much;" 1 <em>Kings</em> 4. 29. He was not reproved for plural
marriage but for marrying strange wives, who led him into idolatry and
wickedness; 1 <em>Kings</em> 11. Many chief men in Israel, to whom the Lord
manifested his favor, were polygamists.
</p>
<p>The following is sometimes quoted as an argument against plural
marriage: "For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
cleave to his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh;" <em>Mark</em> 10. 7,
8. But "Know ye not that he which is joined to a harlot is one body?
for two, saith he, shall be one flesh;" 1 <em>Cor</em>. 6. 16, shows that it
has no connection with the subject.
</p>
<p>"A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife;" 1 <em>Tim</em>.
3. 2, and let deacons be the husbands of one wife; <em>verse</em> 12, are
supposed by some to limit officers in the church, and by inference
all men, to one wife. But when the passages are taken in connection
with the context, which is an enumeration of several qualifications
necessary for bishops and deacons, there is but one reasonable
construction&mdash;that these officers of the church should be married men.
</p>
<p>The Latter-day Saints believe that all men should marry; <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>.
49. 15-17. The Lord is "of purer eyes than to behold evil, and can not
look upon iniquity;" <em>Hab</em>. 1. 13; and says, that "A bastard shall not
enter into the congregation of the Lord; even to his tenth generation;"
<em>Deut</em>. 23. 2. Yet the patriarchs of the twelve tribes of Israel were
the sons of four wives of Jacob; <em>Gen</em>. 35. 22-26.
</p>
<p>Joseph, the first son of Rachel, the second wife of Jacob, received
especial blessings; <em>Gen</em>. 49. 22-26. The Lord called to Samuel, the
son of a polygamous father; 1 <em>Sam</em>. 3. 4-14. Solomon was the son of a
polygamist, yet he was a child of promise; 1 <em>Chron</em>. 22. 9, 10. Jesus
Christ was descended from David through Solomon the son of her who had
been the wife of Uriah; <em>Matt</em>. 1. 1-17.
</p>
<p>The Lord said to Isaiah, "Lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my
people their transgressions, and the house of Jacob their sins;" 58. 1.
This commission was to be faithfully executed; <em>Ezek</em>. 3. 18. Polygamy
was common in the Jewish nation, yet none of the prophets reproved
them for it; but they were sharply reproved for adultery, whoredom,
fornication, and other sins; <em>Jer</em>. 5. 7, 8, 23. <em>Ezek</em>. 22. <em>Chap</em>.
23. 36-44.
</p>
<p>History evidences that plurality of wives was generally customary among
the nations of Asia, yet it is not condemned in any of the epistles of
the apostles, nor does John the Revelator mention it in the letters he
was commanded to write to the seven churches of Asia.
</p>
<p>Paul mentions nearly every crime, in 1 <em>Cor</em>. 6. 9, 10, but, says
nothing about plurality of wives. Every species of commerce between
the sexes, outside of marriage, is often mentioned in the scriptures
as crime, but plural marriage is never, except on the part of the
woman, who is forbidden to marry another man during the lifetime of her
husband; <em>Rom</em>. 7. 3.
</p>
<p>Had plurality of wives been sinful in man, the inference is reasonable
that it would have been equally condemned. Although plural marriage was
customary in the days of the patriarchs, some assert that it was done
away in Christ. This would seem very inconsistent when he himself was
of a polygamous lineage. He was born and filled his earthly mission
among a polygamous people, yet, he never reproved them for their plural
marriages. There is nothing in the inspired writings to infer that he
reproved or did away with either polygamy or monogamy. The following is
from the Book of Mormon on this subject: The Lord, through dreams and
visions and the ministry of angels, directed a Jewish prophet by the
name of Lehi, to leave Jerusalem, 600 years B. C., with his family and
others, for the purpose of colonizing America.
</p>
<p>It was then a dark period in the history of Israel, as is evident from
the Bible history of the times, and from the opening chapters of the
Book of Mormon.
</p>
<p>The brilliant reign of Solomon had deeply planted in Israel the sins
of idolatry and sexual wickedness. His reign was the pride of Israel,
and its effects were deep and lasting. It hastened the destruction of
the ten tribes, as a people, some one hundred and twenty years before
the exodus of Lehi, and at that time was about to culminate in the
destruction of Jerusalem and in the Babylonish captivity.
</p>
<p>With all his wisdom, Solomon had disobeyed two very important
commandments, one especially to the kings of Israel: "Neither shall he
multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away;" <em>Deut</em>. 17.
17. The other was to all Israel, that they should not marry into the
idolatrous nations around them: "Neither shalt thou make marriages with
them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter
shalt thou take unto thy son;" <em>Deut</em>. 7. 3. <em>Ezra</em>, <em>chapters</em> 9. 10.
</p>
<p>Through disobedience to these injunctions, his heart had turned away
from the Lord, and he had been led into idolatry and wickedness. At
his death he not only left the influence of his personal example, but,
also, a numerous family who, from their great wealth and high social
position, must have exercised a powerful and lasting influence for
evil, which, with other causes, resulted, in less than three hundred
years, in the scattering of the ten tribes among the nations of Asia,
and the occupation of their country by strangers, and in less than four
hundred years, in the destruction of Jerusalem, and in the Babylonish
captivity.
</p>
<p>The sexual wickedness which had become prevalent in Israel, and the
consequent abuse of the marriage relations, was, evidently, the reason
why the Lord commanded that the children of Lehi should have but one
wife, for he said to the Nephites, through his prophet Jacob, "This
people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures;
for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of
the things which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son;"
2. 23.
</p>
<p>That is, they excused themselves with the example of these kings for
breaking the special command of God to them, that they should have
but one wife, and like those eminent persons, ran into excess and
wickedness, as their fathers had done before them.
</p>
<p>To neutralize the evil effects of the bad example of their fathers was
evidently the reason why the Lord commanded the Nephites, "For there
shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he
shall have none;" <em>verse</em> 27. Plural marriage would have been whoredom
to the Nephites, because the Lord had forbidden it.
</p>
<p>That the prophet Jacob foresaw, prophetically, that at some future
period this restriction would be taken off is evident from <em>verse</em> 30,
"For if I will, saith the Lord of hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will
command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things."
That is, they were required to limit themselves to one wife, until the
Lord should order it otherwise, and by implication, when he instructed
them to take more than one wife, it would be justifiable.
</p>
<p>In the thirty-first verse the Lord gives a reason for forbidding plural
marriage among the Nephites, "For behold, I, the Lord, have seen the
sorrow, and heard the mourning of the daughters of my people in the
land of Jerusalem; yea, and in all the lands of my people, because of
the wickedness and abominations of their husbands."
</p>
<p>These teachings of the prophet Jacob cannot be presumed, even by
opposers of plural marriage, to do away with the tenor of the Jewish
Scriptures, for we are informed in 2 <em>Nephi</em> 3. 12, that the record of
the Jews and of the Nephites, should grow together unto the confounding
of false doctrine in the latter-days.
</p>
<p>The prophet Jacob could not have intended to condemn a principle
on which is based the legitimacy of our Savior, of prophets and
patriarchs, and indeed of the whole house of Israel. The words
"multiply," and "greatly," in <em>Deut</em>. 17. 17, evidently imply excess
and unreasonable indulgence, as in the case of David and Uriah, and in
taking strange women, as in the case of Solomon.
</p>
<p>The absurdity of the argument that these passages imply that a man
should have but one wife, is evident from the previous verse, that the
kings of Israel should "not multiply horses to themselves." No one
would be so unreasonable as to suppose that the Lord designed to limit
the kings of Israel to one horse.
</p>
<p>The Lord gave Joseph Smith a very important revelation on this
subject. It is contained in <em>Sec</em>. 132, <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. It is entitled
a "Revelation on the Eternity of the Marriage Covenant, Including
Plurality of Wives."
</p>
<p>It commences by stating that the prophet Joseph Smith, Jun., inquired
of the Lord, how it was that his servants anciently were justified in
having many wives and concubines. The Lord did not answer his question
at once, but tells him, in the third verse, to prepare his heart to
receive and obey the instructions he was about to give him.
</p>
<p>In the fourth verse the Lord said to him, "I reveal unto you a new
and an everlasting covenant." We find the general principle involved
in that covenant, directly stated in the seventh, thirteenth and
fourteenth verses:
</p>
<p>"And verily I say unto you, that the conditions of this law are
these:&mdash;All covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows,
performances, connections, associations, or expectations, that are not
made, and entered into, and sealed, by the Holy Spirit of promise, of
him who is anointed, both as well for time and for all eternity, and
that too most holy, by revelation and commandment through the medium of
mine anointed, whom I have appointed on the earth to hold this power,
(and I have appointed unto my servant Joseph to hold this power in the
last days, and there is never but one on the earth at a time, on whom
this power and the Keys of this Priesthood are conferred,) are of no
efficacy, virtue or force, in and after the resurrection from the dead;
for all contracts that are not made unto this end, have an end when men
are dead. * * * * And everything that is in the world, whether it be
ordained of men, by thrones, or principalities, or powers, or things
of name, whatsoever they may be, that are not by me, or by my word,
saith the Lord, shall be thrown down, and shall not remain after men
are dead, neither in nor after the resurrection, saith the Lord your
God; for whatsoever things remain, are by me; and whatsoever things are
not by me, shall be shaken and destroyed." We find a direct application
of this law to the marriage relations in <em>verses</em> 15 and 19: "If a man
marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me, nor by my
word; and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world, and she
with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are
dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound
by any law when they are out of the world. * * * And again, verily I
say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and
by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by
the Holy Spirit of promise, by him who is anointed, unto whom I have
appointed this power, and the keys of this Priesthood; and it shall
be said unto them, ye shall come forth in the first resurrection; and
if it be after the first resurrection, in the next resurrection; and
shall inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, dominions,
all heights and depths&mdash;then shall it be written in the Lamb's Book of
Life, that he shall commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood,
and if ye abide in my covenant, and commit no murder whereby to shed
innocent blood, it shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever
my servant hath put upon them, in time, and through all eternity,
and shall be of full force when they are out of the world; and they
shall pass by the angels, and the Gods, which are set there, to their
exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their
heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds
forever and ever."
</p>
<p>The above quotations evidence, that only those who comply with the law
will continue in the marriage relations after death; consequently only
those who comply with the law can expect a continuation of posterity
in the world to come, and the consequent glory and power pertaining to
that condition.
</p>
<p>The law of the Lord is very plain on this subject. Who can question his
right to dictate the marriages of his sons and daughters, that they and
their generations may be fitted for his presence?
</p>
<p>In <em>verse</em> 29, the Lord begins to answer the question in the first
verse: "Abraham received all things, whatsoever he received, by
revelation and commandment." "God commanded Abraham, and Sarah gave
Hagar to Abraham to wife;" <em>verse</em> 34. That is, God commanded Abraham
to receive Hagar and commanded his already covenant wife to give her
handmaid to him. "And why did she do it? Because this was the law."
The reason why Abraham was not under condemnation, is very forcibly
expressed in the latter part of <em>verse</em> 35: "For I, the Lord, commanded
it." In <em>verses</em> 36-39, the principle is well elucidated, that, in
nothing did the ancients sin except in things which they received not
of God.
</p>
<p>In <em>verse</em> 40, the Lord says to Joseph, the Seer: "I gave unto thee, my
servant Joseph, an appointment, and restore all things." And from the
tenor of the Revelation, "all things" must include plurality of wives
and the eternity of the marriage covenant.
</p>
<p>This subject may be readily summed up as follows: If a man has a wife
in the world to come, she will be a gift from the Lord, through the
covenants he has ordained, and that man is justifiable in receiving all
the wives the Lord sees fit to give him, through the authority he has
appointed on the earth.
</p>
<p>Many elders of the Latter-day Saints have been commanded, as was
Abraham, to enter into plural marriage, and disobedience becomes
transgression. Hence it involves a religious principle, and becomes a
matter of conscience. "Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart,
and shalt cleave unto her and none else;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 42. 22, is
sometimes referred to as an argument against plural marriage.
</p>
<p>If it would admit of this construction, it would not be valid as an
argument, from the fact, that the revelation of which it forms a
part was given previous to that on the plurality and eternity of the
marriage relations, and consequently, before the church was prepared
to receive such a revelation. It evidently admits of the construction,
that a man may have more than one wife, and yet cleave to none but his
wife. That is, it forbids all sexual commerce outside of the marriage
covenant.

<a name="concubines"></a><h3>CONCUBINES.
</h3>
<p>A concubine "In scripture signifies a wife of the second rank, who was
inferior to the matron, or mistress of the house.
</p>
<p>"The chief wives differed from the concubines in that they were taken
into covenant with their husband by solemn stipulation, and with
consent and rejoicing of friends.
</p>
<p>"They brought with them dowries to their husbands. They had the
government of their families under and with their husbands. The
inheritance belonged to the children brought forth by them.
</p>
<p>"Though the children of the concubines did not inherit their father's
estate, yet the father in his life time provided for them, and made
presents to them:
</p>
<p><em>Thus</em> Sarah <em>was</em> Abraham's <em>wife of whom</em> he <em>had</em> Isaac, <em>the heir
of all his wealth</em>. <em>But he had besides two</em> concubines, namely, Hagar
<em>and</em> Keturah; <em>of these he had children, whom he distinguished from</em>
Isaac, <em>and made</em> presents to them;" (<em>see Concubine, Cru. Concor</em>.)
</p>
<p>Although Hagar is considered a concubine in the above quotation, yet,
according to Cruden's definition, she was a wife of the second degree.
She is nowhere called a concubine in the scripture, but emphatically a
wife.
</p>
<p>"And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, * * and
gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife;" <em>Gen</em>. 16. 3. That this
condition of wifehood did not change the former relations of mistress
and servant, between Sarai and Hagar, is evident from <em>verse</em> 9. The
angel said to Hagar, "Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under
her hands."
</p>
<p>That Keturah was Abraham's wife is evident from the fact, that she
is called his wife in <em>Gen</em>. 25. 1: and that she was also called his
concubine, appears from 1 <em>Chron</em>. 1. 32. That concubine and wife were
synonymous terms, further appears from the declaration of Nathan, the
prophet, to David, "I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give
<em>them</em> unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight
of this sun;" 2 <em>Sam</em>. 12. 11. In the account of the fulfilment of this
prophecy, these wives are called concubines. "And Absalom went in unto
his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel;" 16. 22.
</p>
<p>The Nephites, whose ancestors colonized America 600 years before
Christ, did not forget the custom of their Jewish fathers; for when
they broke the special commandment of the Lord to them, by taking more
than one wife, they also added concubines; <em>Mos</em>. 11. 2-4.
</p>
<p>This custom of taking wives and concubines prevailed among the
Jaredites, whose ancestors emigrated to North America from the tower
of Babel. It appears to have been abused by a wicked king, called
Riplakish, who reigned some 1500 years before Christ; <em>Ether</em> 10. 5.
From both the Bible and Book of Mormon, it appears that the custom of
taking a plurality of wives and concubines prevailed at a very early
period after the flood. It was, however, of antediluvian origin:
"And Lamech took unto himself two wives, Adah and Zillah;" <em>Gen</em>. 4.
19. he lived before the flood. It is evident from the "Revelation
on the Eternity of the Marriage Covenant," that the Lord anciently
gave concubines to good men, as wives, and that only the custom of
the country discriminated between them and others: "Abraham received
concubines, and they bare him children, and it was accounted unto him
for righteousness, because they were given unto him;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>.
132. 37. "David's wives and concubines were given unto him, of me, by
the hand of Nathan, my servant, and others of the prophets who had the
keys of this power; and in none of these things did he sin against me,
save in the case of Uriah and his wife;" <em>verse</em> 39.
</p>
<p>We cannot presume that the Lord ever gave women to these men under
any title, except for the noble purpose of parentage. Concubinage is
unknown among the Latter-day Saints. Wifehood, in the fullest sense of
the word, is conferred by the marriage covenant. All a man's children
are his legitimate heirs, both by law and custom.

<a name="foreordination"></a><h2>FOREORDINATION&mdash;ELECTION.
</h2>
<p>"Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world;"
<em>Acts</em> 15. 18.
</p>
<p>The knowledge that we have of the beginning of the world is principally
derived from the history of its creation in the Bible Genesis, and in
the writings of Moses and of Abraham, as given in <em>P. of G. P., pages</em>
4-7, and 32-36.
</p>
<p>Abraham says, "Now the Lord had shewn unto me, Abraham, the
intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all
these there were many of the noble and great ones; and God saw these
souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he
said, These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were
spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me, Abraham,
thou art one of them, thou wast chosen before thou wast born;" <em>P. of
G. P., page</em> 32.
</p>
<p>These writings make it plain that man existed in a spiritual
condition prior to coming here, and also quite as evident that in
that pre-existence he exercised his free agency. These facts throw
much light on the following passages: "Him, being delivered by the
determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by
wicked hands have crucified and Slain;" <em>Acts</em> 2. 23. "For whom he did
foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his
Son;" <em>Rom</em>. 8. 29.
</p>
<p>"Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called;" <em>verse</em> 30.
"God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew;" 11. 2. "For the
gifts and calling of God are without repentance;" <em>verse</em> 29.
</p>
<p>The last passage explains the previous ones. God may have called and
chosen men in their first estate, or spiritual existence, but whether
they will accept that call and fill it, by repentance and good works in
this life, is a matter in which it is their privilege to exercise their
free agency.
</p>
<p>This idea is illustrated in the case of the Roman centurion, who had
faith that his sick servant would be healed if Jesus would only speak
the word. Jesus said to those around him, "That many shall come from
the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and
Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven: But the children of the kingdom shall
be cast out into outer darkness;" <em>Matt</em>. 8. 11, 12.
</p>
<p>The "Children of the kingdom" evidently refers to Israel, the called
and chosen of God. The passages are numerous in which Israel is called
the "Chosen of God;" "The elect according to the covenant." "Hearken
unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called;" <em>Isa</em>. 48. 12.
</p>
<p>Jesus, when he predicted the destruction of Jerusalem, and the
scattering of the Jews, declared that for the elect's sake those days
should be shortened; <em>Matt</em>. 24. 22.
</p>
<p>The elect could only mean according to the covenant with Abraham for
the remnant who were saved in the flesh were of a wicked generation,
and they and their children became a hiss and a by-word among all
nations, consequently they could not have been the elect through faith
and good works.
</p>
<p>David said to the congregation, "Solomon, my son, whom alone God hath
chosen;" 1 <em>Chron</em>. 29. 1. Yet Solomon did not fully prove himself by
good works, for he fell into transgression and corrupted Israel; 1
<em>Kings</em> 11. 9-11.
</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon is plain on this subject: "Being called and prepared
from the foundation of the world, according to the foreknowledge of
God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works; in the first
place being left to choose good or evil;" <em>Alma</em> 13. 3-7.
</p>
<p>Their calling and preparation from the foundation of the world were
evidently based on their faith and good works, previous to their being
called, and not on the possibilities of their future good conduct.
</p>
<p>This idea is verified by the apostle who, speaking of Christ, says,
"And again, when he bringeth in the first-begotten into the world, he
saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. * * * Thou hast loved
righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath
anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows;" <em>Heb</em>. 1.
6, 9. "Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world,
but was manifest in these last times for you;" 1 <em>Pet</em>. 1. 20. Christ
was chosen before the foundation of the world, because he had already
proven himself worthy.
</p>
<p>Men exercised their free agency in the first or spiritual estate, as
well as in this. That the character of their works in that estate
shaped their destiny in this is evident. The Lord said to Abraham,
"They who keep their first estate, shall be added upon; and they who
keep not their first estate, shall not have glory in the same kingdom
with those who keep their first estate;" <em>P. of G. P., page</em> 32.
</p>
<p>There are some foreordained to condemnation: "There are certain
men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this
condemnation;" <em>Jude</em> 4.
</p>
<p>"The angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own
habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto
the judgment of the great day;" <em>Jude</em> 6. That is, those angels who,
voluntarily, by their own acts, forfeited the glory prepared for them.
</p>
<p>The Lord revealed to Joseph, the Seer, that the only ones who should
not be redeemed in the due time of the Lord are those who "Having
denied the Holy Spirit after having received it, and having denied the
Only Begotten Son of the Father&mdash;having crucified him unto themselves,
and put him to an open shame." <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 76. 31-43. We learn from
the Book of Mormon also "The way is prepared for all men from the
foundation of the world, if so be that they repent and come unto him."

<a name="Dispensation"></a><h2>DISPENSATION OF THE FULNESS OF TIMES.
</h2>
<p>A dispensation "is power and authority to dispense the word of God, and
to administer in all the ordinances thereof." What the dispensation
of the fulness of times is, is well expressed by the apostle Paul
in <em>Eph</em>. 1. 9, "Having made known unto us the mystery of his will,
according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: that
in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in
one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on
earth, even in him."
</p>
<p>It is still more comprehensively expressed by the prophet Joseph. "Now
the thing to be known is, what the fulness of times means, or the
extent and authority thereof. It means this, that the dispensation of
the fulness of times is made up of all the dispensations that ever have
been given since the world began, until this time. Unto Adam first was
given a dispensation. It is well known that God spake to him with his
own voice in the garden, and gave him the promise of the Messiah."
</p>
<p>"And unto Noah also was a dispensation given; for Jesus said, 'As it
was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the coming
of the Son of Man;' and as the righteous were saved then, and the
wicked destroyed, so will it be now. And from Noah to Abraham, and from
Abraham to Moses, and from Moses to Elias, and from Elias to John the
Baptist, and from then to Jesus Christ, and from Jesus Christ to Peter,
James, and John, the Apostles all having received in their dispensation
by revelation from God, to accomplish the great scheme of restitution,
spoken by all the holy Prophets since the world began; the end of which
is, the dispensation of the fulness of times, in which all things shall
be fulfilled that have been spoken of since the earth was made." <em>Mil.
Star, vol</em>. 16, <em>page</em> 220. The apostle Paul further says on this
subject, "For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this
mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits, that blindness in
part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come
in. And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall
come out of Zion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from
Jacob;" <em>Rom</em>. 11. 25, 26.
</p>
<p>These passages make it evident, in connection with other passages, that
the dispensation of the fulness of times will commence when the fulness
of the Gentiles shall come in, for then will a Deliverer come out of
Zion who shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.
</p>
<p>This dispensation of the fulness of times is a period in which all
things will be restored to their proper order or condition.
</p>
<p>The apostle Peter had a very comprehensive view of this subject when he
severely reproved the Jews for killing the "Prince of Life," and said
to them, "Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be
blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence
of the Lord."
</p>
<p>This was evidently to take place when Israel should be gathered and
the Gospel restored, in its fulness: "And he shall send Jesus Christ,
which before was preached unto you: whom the heavens must receive until
the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the
mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began;" <em>Acts</em> 3. 19,
21. Peter gave them to understand that not until then could those who
killed the "Prince of Life" expect to be restored to the privileges of
the Gospel which was preached to them while in the flesh.
</p>
<p>In this time of restitution everything in heaven and in earth will find
its appropriate place and condition, and good and evil will find their
fulness of reward.
</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon is very plain on this subject: "The meaning of
the word restoration, is to bring back again evil for evil, or
carnal for carnal, or devilish for devilish; good for that which is
good; righteous for that which is righteous; just for that which is
just; merciful for that which is merciful. * * * Deal justly, judge
righteously, and if ye do all these things, then shall ye receive your
reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall
have justice restored to you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment
restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you
again; for that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and
be restored; therefore, the word restoration more fully condemneth the
sinner, and justifieth him not at all;" <em>Alma</em> 41. 13-15.
</p>
<p>This principle of restitution has also been further revealed in this
dispensation: "Unto the day when the Lord shall come to recompense unto
every man according to his works, and measure to every man according
to the measure which he has measured to his fellow man;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>.
1. 10. The following passage warns us that the time is near when the
evil and the good will each find their own place: "The hour is not yet,
but is nigh at hand, when peace shall be taken from the earth, and the
devil shall have power over his own dominion; and also the Lord shall
have power over his Saints, and shall reign in their midst;" 35, 36.
</p>
<p>All the intelligences, of whatever order, pertaining to this earth,
will be redeemed from death through the resurrection, except the
sons of perdition. The great burden of the ancient prophets was the
restoration, in the latter times, of the house of Israel to the lands
of their inheritance, and to the favor of God. On the other hand, those
who have oppressed and persecuted them must suffer the full reward of
their evil works.
</p>
<p>This world, in its present condition, is one of antagonisms. When all
things are restored to their proper place, these antagonisms will
cease, and the good and the evil will be placed in positions where they
will harmonize with their surroundings.
</p>
<p>The term, "Dispensation of the fulness of times," refers to the latter
days, when the fulness of the Gospel will be revealed, and the holy
Priesthood be restored to the earth. Under its direction the work of
restoration will commence and be fully consummated, through the great
plan of redemption for man and the earth, which was decided in the
councils of heaven before the foundations of the earth were laid.

<a name="spiritofgod"></a><h2>THE SPIRIT OF GOD, OR HOLY GHOST.
</h2>
<p>Whenever the Priesthood has been on the earth, through it, and in
various ways, the Lord has revealed his will to man. By his voice:
"They heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden;" <em>Gen</em>. 3.
8. The Lord talked with Abraham; <em>chap</em>. 18. And with Moses; <em>Exo</em>. 3.
He called to young Samuel; 1 <em>Sam</em>. 3.
</p>
<p>Passages are numerous in the inspired writings in which it says "The
Lord hath spoken;" "The Lord spake;" "Thus saith the Lord;" etc. He has
often revealed his will through the ministrations of angels, by visions
and dreams, by signs and tokens; but the more general way has been
through the agency of his Spirit, or the Holy Ghost.
</p>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith has informed us that "The Holy Ghost has not a
body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit." <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>.
130, 22, 23.
</p>
<p>Its office is to enlighten the understanding and give knowledge and
wisdom; <em>Exo</em>. 31. 1-11. 1 <em>Chron</em>. 28. 12. "But the Comforter, <em>which</em>
is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach
you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I
have said unto you;" <em>John</em> 14. 26.
</p>
<p>It is the Spirit of prophecy, and reveals future events, "For the
prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God
spake <em>as they were</em> moved by the Holy Ghost;" 2 <em>Pet</em>. 1. 21.
</p>
<p>It is a witness and testifies to man, of God and his attributes. "Even
so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God:" 1 <em>Cor</em>.
2. 11. "We are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy
Ghost;" <em>Acts</em> 5. 32. <em>Chap</em>. 20. 23. "No man can say that Jesus is the
Lord, but by the Holy Ghost;" 1 <em>Cor</em>. 12. 3. It gives the knowledge
that is essential to salvation. "When he, the Spirit of truth, is come,
he will guide you into all truth." <em>John</em> 16. 13.
</p>
<p>Nephite prophets declared, that, after Christ should be slain, "He
should rise from the dead, and should make himself manifest, by the
Holy Ghost, unto the Gentiles;" 1 <em>Nephi</em> 10. 11. 3 <em>Nephi</em> 15. 23.
"The mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the
Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old, and as well in
times of old as in times to come;" 1 <em>Nephi</em> 10. 19.
</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost bears record of the Father and of the Son; 3 <em>Nephi</em> 11.
32. The Holy Ghost and Spirit of God are synonymous. The gifts of the
Spirit mentioned in 1 <em>Cor</em>. <em>chap</em>. 12, are often mentioned in the
inspired writings as gifts of the Holy Ghost.
</p>
<p>The Comforter, and the Spirit of Truth are also synonymous with the
Holy Ghost. "But the Comforter which is the Holy Ghost;" <em>John</em> 14. 26.
"But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the
Father, <em>even</em> the Spirit of Truth;" <em>John</em> 15. 26.
</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost is the moving power in the salvation of the human
family, for faith is one of its gifts; 1 <em>Cor</em>. 12. 9. And all
intelligences work by faith. <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>., <em>Lec. on Faith</em>; 1. 11.
</p>
<p>The Spirit of God is not only the medium by which knowledge is
communicated to man, but it is the power by which all organizations are
developed, and by which they exist and move. It is the agent of God's
power by which, through faith, the elements are controlled. "And the
Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters;" <em>Gen</em>. 1. 2. "By his
Spirit he hath garnished the heavens;" <em>Job</em> 26. 13. "The Spirit of
God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life;"
33. 4. "If he gather unto himself his Spirit and his breath; all flesh
shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust;" 34. 14, 15.
"Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created;" <em>Psalm</em> 104. 30.
"For by the power of my Spirit created I them; yea, all things both
spiritual and temporal;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>., 29. 31. "The power of my Spirit
quickeneth all things;" 33. 16.
</p>
<p>By it the Lord works his will among the nations: "I have called upon
the weak things of the world, those who are unlearned and despised, to
thresh the nations by the power of my Spirit;" 35. 13. "The elements
are the tabernacle of God;" 93. 35. Through the power of the Spirit
which pervades them, they are organized and disorganized in accordance
with the laws by which they are governed. Spirit and element must be
inseparably connected, through the resurrection, in order to attain the
greatest perfection; <em>verses</em> 33, 34.
</p>
<p>Man, ignorant of God and his attributes, increases in knowledge by
experience and observation, explores the fields of nature, watches
and experiments with the elements, acquires, to him, new and grand
truths, makes discoveries in science which measurably revolutionize
the conditions of human life, and thinks, in his ignorance of the
spiritual elements, that he accomplishes these important results by
his own unaided wisdom, when they are the effects of the workings of
that universal spirit of intelligence which emanates from the Father of
light, without which man would be like the blind, who wander about at
noonday, unconscious of the light that shines around them.
</p>
<p>Man observes a universal energy in nature. Organization and
disorganization succeed each other. The thunders roll through the
heavens; the earth trembles and becomes broken by earthquakes;
fires consume cities and forests; the waters accumulate, flow over
their usual bounds and cause destruction of life and property; the
worlds perform their revolutions in space with a velocity and power
incomprehensible to man, and he, covered with a veil of darkness, calls
this universal energy, God, when it is the workings of his Spirit,
the obedient agent of his power, the wonder-working and life-giving
principle in all nature.

<a name="Church"></a><h2>NAME OF CHRIST'S CHURCH.
</h2>
<p>The name, Saint, "Signifies a holy or godly person, one that is so by
profession, covenant, and conversation;" <em>Cru</em>. <em>Con</em>.
</p>
<p>In the Old Testament it means one who worked righteousness, and one
in whom the Lord delighted, for that reason. "But to the Saints that
<em>are</em> in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight;"
<em>Psalm</em> 16. 3. "Gather my Saints together unto me; those that have made
a covenant with me by sacrifice;" <em>Psalm</em> 50. 5.
</p>
<p>While the meaning of the term Saints is not changed in the New
Testament, it is used in the epistles of the apostles as a general name
of the followers of Jesus Christ; "To the Saints which are at Ephesus,
and to the faithful in Christ Jesus;" <em>Eph</em>. 1. 1. They are those
who have submitted themselves to Jesus Christ, and have become his
subjects. "Just and true are thy ways, thou king of Saints;" <em>Rev</em>. 15.
3.
</p>
<p>Jesus said, "I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if
another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive;" <em>John</em> 5. 43.
This saying of our Savior's is as applicable to the Christian world
to-day, as it was to the people to whom he spake. The Latter-day Saints
have come in the name of Jesus Christ, and preached the Gospel of
repentance as he preached it, and do all things in his name, and, yet,
the most of the world reject them.
</p>
<p>Some Christian sects have derived their names from their founders, as
Calvanists, Lutherans, Wesleyans. Others have some appellation growing
out of a peculiarity of doctrine, or faith, as Baptists, Methodists
and Presbyterians. Others again derive their name from historical
events connected with their origin, and geographical location, as Roman
Catholic Church, Greek Church, Church of England, etc. Not a church
in all the world bearing the name of Jesus Christ, except that of the
Latter-day Saints.
</p>
<p>Sectarians may ask, are we not called Christians? But the name of our
Savior was Jesus Christ, not Christian. The early Christians first
received that name at the city of Antioch; <em>Acts</em> 11. 26.
</p>
<p>We find that the apostles, in their epistles, addressed the members of
the various churches, as Saints, "Beloved of God, called to be Saints;"
<em>Rom</em>. 1. 7. "To the Saints and faithful brethren in Christ;" <em>Col</em>.
1. 2. We further find that the apostles do not speak of themselves as
followers of men; but Paul calls himself, "An apostle of Jesus Christ
by the will of God;" <em>Col</em>. 1. 1. 1 <em>Tim</em>. 1. 1. "Paul, a servant of
God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's
elect;" <em>Titus</em> 1. 1. Not according to the doctrines of Luther, Calvin
or Wesley.
</p>
<p>The most definite instructions on this subject are found in the Book of
Mormon. When the Nephite disciples of Jesus were, at a certain time,
united in mighty prayer and fasting, he came and stood in the midst of
them, and asked them, "What will ye that I shall give unto you?" "And
they said unto him, Lord, we will that thou wouldst tell us the name
whereby we shall call this church; for there are disputations among the
people concerning this matter.
</p>
<p>"And the Lord said unto them, Verily, verily I say unto you, why is it
that the people should murmur and dispute because of this thing? Have
they not read the scriptures, which say ye must take upon you the name
of Christ, which is my name? For by this name shall ye be called at the
last day; and whoso taketh upon him my name, and endureth to the end,
the same shall be saved at the last day; therefore whatsoever ye shall
do, ye shall do it in my name; therefore ye shall call the church in my
name; and ye shall call upon the Father in my name, that he will bless
the church for my sake; and how be it my church, save it be called in
my name? For if a church be called in Moses' name, then it be Moses'
church; or if it be called in the name of a man, then it be the church
of a man; but if it be called in my name, then it is my church, if so
be that they are built upon my Gospel;" 3 <em>Nephi</em> 27. 2-8.
</p>
<p>In accordance with the spirit of the Old and New Testaments, and with
these instructions of Jesus Christ, when the church was organized on
Gospel principles, by Joseph Smith, Jun., in 1830, it was named, "The
Church of Jesus Christ." The Lord afterwards revealed to his Prophet,
Joseph Smith, that it should be called, "The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 115. 3, 4.

<a name="tithing"></a><h2>TITHING.
</h2>
<p>The history of ancient Israel, as given in the Old Testament, evidences
that the law of tithing was in force from Abraham until their
destruction as a nation. That it was a perpetual law of the Priesthood,
and did not pertain, exclusively, to the Mosaic dispensation, is
apparent, from the fact that Abram paid tithes to Melchisedek; <em>Gen</em>.
14. 20, and that Jacob covenanted to give a tenth to the Lord; 28. 22.
They lived before Moses.
</p>
<p>In the present dispensation the law of tithing was revived, and the
keeping of that law is one of the first duties of the Latter-day
Saints. About eighteen months after the organization of the church,
September 11, 1831, the Lord, through Joseph the Seer, made this
important declaration. Speaking after the manner of the Lord, he called
"to-day," from the giving of the revelation until the coming of the Son
of Man, and said, "Verily I say unto you, it is a day of sacrifice,
and a day for the tithing of my people; for he that is tithed shall
not be burned. For after to-day cometh the burning." That is, at the
coming of the Son of Man; "For verily I say, to-morrow"&mdash;that is, at my
coming&mdash;"all the proud and they that do wickedly shall be as stubble;
and I will burn them up, for I am the Lord of Hosts;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 64.
23, 24.
</p>
<p>In this declaration we are assured that all who call themselves the
Lord's people, and do not pay their tithing, will find their portion
among the wicked at his coming, and will share their fate. In <em>sec</em>.
85. 3, the Lord reiterates the fact, that it is necessary his people
should be tithed, "To prepare them against the day of vengeance and
burning."
</p>
<p>The names of those who do not keep this law of tithing shall not be
enrolled with the people of God: "Neither is their genealogy to be
kept, or to be had where it may be found on any of the records or
history of the church; Their names shall not be found, neither the
names of the fathers, nor the names of the children written in the book
of the law of God, saith the Lord of Hosts;" 85. 4, 5. This revelation
was also given soon after the organization of the Church; Nov. 27, 1832.
</p>
<p>Like every principle connected with the latter-day work, tithing must
needs commence with the leaders of the Dispensation. The following very
interesting account of the first covenant and promise concerning this
principle will be found in the History of Joseph Smith, under date of
Nov. 29, 1834.
</p>
<p>The occasion was one of rejoicing for the blessings received of the
Lord. The narrative says: "After commencing and rejoicing before the
Lord on this occasion, we agreed to enter into the following covenant
with the Lord, viz.:&mdash;That if the Lord will prosper us in our business,
and open the way before us, that we may obtain means to pay our debts,
that we be not troubled nor brought into disrepute before the world,
nor His people; after that, of all that He shall give us, we will give
a tenth, to be bestowed upon the poor in His Church, or as He shall
command; and that we will be faithful over that which He has entrusted
to our care, that we may obtain much; and that our children after us,
shall remember to observe <em>this sacred and holy covenant</em>; and that our
children, and our children's children, may know of the same, we have
subscribed our names with our own hands.
</p>
<p>"JOSEPH SMITH, JUN.,
</p>
<p>"OLIVER COWDERY."
</p>
<p>After the above covenant the following is recorded: "And now, O
Father, as thou didst prosper our father Jacob, and bless him with
protection and prosperity wherever he went, from the time he made
a like covenant before and with thee; as thou didst, even the same
night, open the heavens unto him, and manifest great mercy and power,
and give him promises, so wilt thou do with us his sons; and as his
blessings prevailed above his progenitors unto the utmost bounds of the
everlasting hills, even so may our blessings prevail like his."
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this principle began to be taught soon after the
organization of the Church, it required some time to reach practical
development, for no definite law concerning it was revealed, until July
8, 1838.
</p>
<p>The custom of paying labor tithing, appears to have been commenced
when building the Nauvoo Temple. Of a meeting of some of the leading
authorities of the Church, in Lima, Illinois, the following is
recorded, in His. of Joseph Smith, under date of October 23, 1841: "It
was moved and seconded, That all those who are willing to consecrate
one-tenth of their time and property to the building of the Temple at
Nauvoo, under the superintendence of President Morley and Counselors,
to signify it by uplifted hands; when the motion was carried
unanimously."
</p>
<p>The following is a "<em>Revelation given through Joseph, the Prophet, at
Far West, Missouri, July 8th, 1838, in answer to the question, O Lord,
show unto thy servants how much thou requirest of the properties of the
people for a tithing</em>?
</p>
<p>"Verily, thus saith the Lord, I require all their surplus property
to be put into the hands of the bishop of my church of Zion, for the
building of mine house, and for the laying of the foundation of Zion
and for the Priesthood, and for the debts of the Presidency of my
church.
</p>
<p>"And this shall be the beginning of the tithing of my people; and after
that, those who have thus been tithed, shall pay one-tenth of all their
interest annually; and this shall be a standing law unto them for ever,
for my holy Priesthood, saith the Lord.
</p>
<p>"Verily I say unto you, it shall come to pass, that all those who
gather unto the land of Zion shall be tithed of their surplus
properties, and shall observe this law, or they shall not be found
worthy to abide among you.
</p>
<p>"And I say unto you, if my people observe not this law, to keep it
holy, and by this law sanctify the land of Zion unto me, that my
statutes and my judgments may be kept thereon, that it may be most
holy, behold, verily I say unto you, it shall not be a land of Zion
unto you; and this shall be an ensample unto all the Stakes of Zion.
Even so. Amen;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov. Sec</em>. 119.
</p>
<p>The law of tithing, as embodied in the revelations referred to, is an
immutable decree of Jehovah to his people, and admits of no evasion
by those who would enjoy the blessings of the faithful on the land of
Zion, or be classed among the righteous, and avoid the burning at the
coming of our Lord.

<a name="Apostacy"></a><h2>APOSTACY OF THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH.
</h2>
<p>The Gospel dispensation inaugurated by our Savior, while on his
earthly mission, was not a gathering one. Israel had already been
widely scattered. That scattering was soon to result in the complete
desolation of the land of Palestine.
</p>
<p>Wherever the people received the Gospel through the preaching of the
apostles, they were organized into churches. They not only had their
old traditions and customs to contend with, but there was no relief
from the general pagan influences under which they had been educated.
Add to these things, the persecutions the early Saints were exposed to,
and it could not well be otherwise than that many of them should be
weak in the faith.
</p>
<p>The epistles of the apostles inform us that they had often contended
with false teachers and doctrines in the primitive churches. "Even
now," said the apostle John, "are there many anti-Christs." 1 <em>John</em>
2. 18. The apostle Paul, in his second epistle to Timothy, informs us,
that "In the last days perilous times shall come;" 2 <em>Tim</em>. 3. 1.
</p>
<p>In the following three verses he enumerates all manner of wickedness
which shall be prevalent in the latter times. He evidently means in the
Christian churches, or among those who profess godliness, for in the
fifth verse of the same chapter, he speaks of their having "A form of
godliness, but denying the power thereof."
</p>
<p>The apostle Paul exhorted the Colossians to "be not moved away from
the hope of the Gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to
every creature which is under heaven;" <em>Col</em>. 1. 23.
</p>
<p>About fifty-seven years after the Savior had closed his earthly
mission, if we are correctly informed in the second and third chapters
of the Revelations of St. John, there were but seven churches in Asia
whom the Lord considered worthy of notice. This, coupled with the
assertion of Paul, that the Gospel had, in his day, been preached to
every creature, proves that its light only faintly glimmered, in the
otherwise universal darkness, which existed at the time John had his
vision on the isle of Patmos.
</p>
<p>John the Revelator saw Rome in all her glory, in his day, reigning over
the kings of the earth, full of riches and all manner of abominations,
and drunken with the blood of the Saints and of the martyrs of Jesus;
<em>Rev</em>. 17. This great power, drenched in the blood of the martyrs,
about 325 A.D., in the reign of Constantine, adopted what was then
known as Christianity, as the religion of the empire.
</p>
<p>It was not possible that such a wicked, corrupt element and the Gospel
of Jesus could have any affinity. Rather, is it not evident that the
antagonism of Christianity and paganism had measurably ceased? that
they had assimilated? that they had both so nearly found the same
level, that with a slight pressure of governmental policy they readily
amalgamated?
</p>
<p>Not only prophecy but general history, and especially the history of
Christianity by its learned professors, furnish abundant evidence of
its early departure from the pure principles of the Gospel.
</p>
<p>The prophetic history of the preparatory work, for the coming of Christ
to reign on the earth in the latter days, is predicated on the apostacy
of the primitive Christian church, the general wickedness of the
nations, and the gathering of the house of Israel.
</p>
<p>Since the calling of Abraham, the authenticated personal manifestations
of the Lord to man have been through him and his family. Christ came
to his own chosen people. His earthly mission was commenced and
consummated in the midst of Israel. The Gospel was first preached to
the Jews. His apostles were chosen from his brethren of the seed of
Abraham. The first church of Christ was established at Jerusalem. The
apostles were commanded to remain there until endowed with power from
on high. All the blessings of salvation are promised to mankind through
the seed of Abraham.
</p>
<p>When the Lord comes in glory and power, the prophets inform us that he
will come to Zion and Jerusalem, the chief cities of gathered Israel.
The apostle Paul informs us that "God hath set some in the church,
first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that
miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of
tongues;" 1 <em>Cor</em>. 12. 28.
</p>
<p>From the above it is evident that, had the church of Christ been on
the earth in the past centuries, it would have been organized like the
primitive church, with apostles and prophets of the house of Israel at
the head of it. More than that, it would have enjoyed all the spiritual
gifts and blessings mentioned in the above chapter.
</p>
<p>John the Revelator, in his visions of the latter times, says, "And I
saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting
Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every
nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people;" <em>Rev</em>. 14. 6.
</p>
<p>No one who has any faith in the Scriptures would assert that the Gospel
preached by Jesus and his apostles was not the "Everlasting Gospel."
If everlasting, it must of necessity be the same wherever found.
If the same Gospel, it would always produce the same results. Its
ordinances would be the same. Its followers would enjoy the same gifts
and blessings. They would call themselves Saints. They would have an
organization that would not vary from the church organized by Jesus and
his apostles. They would have been led by apostles and prophets of the
house of Israel.
</p>
<p>Instead of this, the Christian churches and nations have for many
centuries ground the House of Israel with the iron heel of oppression.
They have robbed, driven and slain the covenant people of God, the
chosen people of that same Jesus of Nazareth whose precepts and example
they profess to follow.
</p>
<p>The Shiloh came and the sceptre departed from Judah. A series of
terrible oppressions commenced under Roman governors, which resulted
in the destruction of Jerusalem, and of the Jews as a nation; that may
be considered the beginning of the fulfilment of the prediction of our
Savior, "Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the
times of the Gentiles be fulfilled;" <em>Luke</em> 21. 24.
</p>
<p>The reasonable construction of this passage is, that "The times of
the Gentiles" means the period in which they will bear rule, oppress
Israel, and hold possession of the heritage of the seed of Abraham.
</p>
<p>When "The times of the Gentiles shall be fulfilled," when the angel,
seen in vision by John the Revelator, shall have brought again to earth
the "Everlasting Gospel," will also be "The times of restitution of all
things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets
since the world began;" <em>Acts</em> 3. 21.
</p>
<p>The first century of the Christian era was a very important one in
the world's history. The covenant people of God ceased to exist as a
nation. The civilized world, represented by the Roman empire, with
Paganism as the prevailing religion, began to fill up the measure
of its iniquity by shedding the blood of the apostles, and of the
disciples of Jesus. Pagan philosophy counteracted Gospel influences.
There was a constant tendency in Christianity and paganism to
assimilate. This is evident from the writings of the apostles.
</p>
<p>That, after Christianity became the leading element of the Roman
empire, it ceased to be regenerative in its nature, is evidenced by
the fact, that the empire was often scourged with destructive civil
wars which prepared it for dissolution. It was finally crushed by
barbarian hordes. They desolated whole provinces, leaving only remnants
of corrupt peoples, to be measurably regenerated by an infusion of
new blood from the plains of eastern Europe, and western Asia. Both
sacred and profane history have failed to record an instance of a
people who, living under the regenerating influences of the Gospel of
Jesus, and enjoying the favor of God, were broken and destroyed by such
terrible scourges as visited the Roman empire the first five centuries
of the Christian era. Modern nations have risen from its ashes, have
adopted its religion, its customs, its ethics, without inspiration
from heaven, without any further Gospel dispensation, without apostles
and prophets of the house of Israel, and without the guidance of the
Holy Priesthood, after the order of the Son of God, which the Lord has
decreed should only come through the seed of Abraham.

<p>The earliest account we have of Jerusalem is in the fourteenth chapter
of Genesis, under the date of 1913 B. C.
</p>
<p>When Abram was returning from the slaughter of the five kings,
Melchisedek, king of Salem, brought him refreshments. He was a
righteous prince and a priest of the Most High God; and he blessed
Abram.
</p>
<p>Josephus, the Jewish historian, states that this city of Salem was
afterwards called Jerusalem; <em>Ant. of the Jews, B</em>. 1., <em>Chapter</em> 10.
It has been the scene of many great events connected with the ministry
of the holy Priesthood on the earth.
</p>
<p>Abram was commanded to offer his son Isaac, on one of the mountains in
the land of Moriah; <em>Gen</em>. 22. 2. Josephus says, that the mountain on
which Abram built an altar, to offer his son Isaac, was the same on
which king David (Solomon) afterwards built a temple.
</p>
<p>The Jebusites retained possession of the city of Jerusalem until 1048
B. C., when it was subdued by David. He first took the stronghold of
Zion; "The same is the city of David." At that time, this was only a
strong outwork or fortification for the defence of the city; 2 <em>Sam</em>.
5. 6-9.
</p>
<p>In the days of Solomon, Jerusalem became a great and strong city, with
a magnificent temple towering on Mount Moriah.
</p>
<p>From its conquest by David, until the death of Solomon, it was the
capital city of Israel, and afterwards of the kingdom of Judah. B. C.
585, Jerusalem was burned by the army of Nebuchadnezzar, and the better
part of the inhabitants of the land were carried captive to Babylon; 3
<em>Kings</em>, <em>chapters</em> 24 and 25.
</p>
<p>The city was re-established at the end of the seventy years' captivity.
It afterwards played an important part in the history of that part of
Asia.
</p>
<p>Almost under the shadow of its walls, our Savior was born. It was
the central place of the scenes of his earthly mission. In it he was
scourged and condemned to death. Just outside of its walls, and in
sight of its towers, and the glorious temple built to his name, the God
of Israel died the death of a malefactor.
</p>
<p>It was here, and near here, that he consummated his earthly mission,
and ascended to his Father.
</p>
<p>In A. C. 70, the land of Judea, and city of Jerusalem, were made a
desolation by the Roman armies, and the Jews, as a nation, entirely
rooted out of their heritage, and scattered among all nations.
</p>
<p>For information on this subject, the student should read, carefully,
Josephus' "<em>Wars of the Jews</em>."
</p>
<p>Up to this time, in her history, many prophecies were fulfilled. In
her future many more are to be fulfilled, for she is yet to take an
important part in the great work of the latter days. Like the New
Jerusalem of the American continent, this city will descend out of
heaven, after the final change of the earth to its celestial condition;
<em>Rev</em>. 21. 10-27.
</p>
<p>It is often called Zion in the Old Testament, and will be the capital
city of gathered Israel on the Eastern hemisphere, in the latter days.
</p>
<p>There are many passages in the Scriptures relating to this important
city. A few are appended to assist the student in further researches
concerning it.
</p>
<p><b>Bible.

<p><em>Deut</em>. 31. 29 evil will befall you in the latter days, because ye will
do evil.
</p>

Solomon.
</p>
<p>14. 15 Lord shall root up Israel, and scatter them beyond the river.

<a name="new"></a><h2>NEW JERUSALEM.
</h2>
<p>The Jaredite prophet, Ether, predicted, 600 B. C., that a city which
should be called a holy city, should be built on the land of North
America, and that it should be built up unto the remnant of the seed
of Joseph. He further informs us, that it should be called the New
Jerusalem, to distinguish it from Jerusalem which should be built on
the eastern hemisphere; <em>Ether</em> 13. 3-8.
</p>
<p>Ether also saw that this New Jerusalem was the one that John the
Revelator saw, in vision, coming down out of heaven. "Until the end
come, when the earth shall pass away, and there shall be a new heaven
and a new earth; and they shall be like unto the old, save the old have
passed away, and all things have become new. And then cometh the New
Jerusalem;" <em>verses</em> 8-10. <em>Rev</em>. 21. 2.
</p>
<p>Our Savior, in his personal ministration among the Nephites, six
hundred years after the predictions of Ether, renews the promise that a
New Jerusalem should be built upon this land.
</p>
<p>Speaking to the Nephites, he says: "This people will I establish in
this land, unto the fulfilling of the covenant which I made with your
father Jacob; and it shall be a New Jerusalem;" 3 <em>Nephi</em> 20. 22.
</p>
<p>The Savior again says, speaking to the Gentiles, that those who shall
come into the covenant, shall "be numbered among this the remnant of
Jacob." "And they shall assist my people, the remnant of Jacob, and
also, as many of the house of Israel as shall come, that they may build
a city, which shall be called the New Jerusalem; and then shall they
assist my people that they may be gathered in, who are scattered upon
all the face of the land in unto the New Jerusalem;" 21. 22-24.
</p>
<p>We learn from the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, that this New
Jerusalem is to be the city of Zion, of the latter days. "And it shall
be called the New Jerusalem, a land of peace, a city of refuge, a place
of safety for the Saints of the most High God; And the glory of the
Lord shall be there, and the terror of the Lord also shall be there,
insomuch that the wicked will not come unto it, and it shall be called
Zion;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 45. 66, 67.
</p>
<p>This is, also, the Zion spoken of by the ancient Jewish prophets,
as separate and distinct from the Zion, or Mount Zion, that was in
Jerusalem, in the land of Palestine.
</p>
<p>In the following passages, evidently, two distinct places are intended.
"Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation;" <em>Isa</em>. 64. 10. "For the
law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem;"
<em>Micah</em> 4. 2.
</p>
<p>There are three Zions spoken of in the sacred writings&mdash;the Zion on the
American continent, the Zion at Jerusalem, and the Zion of Enoch. For
some account of the Zion of Enoch, <em>see Pearl of Great Price, pages</em>
18-22. On the 22d page we learn, that, when Christ shall come, the Zion
of the western hemisphere and the Zion of Enoch shall be united in one.
There the Lord will reside, and it will be the gathered Zion "which
shall come forth out of all the creations which I have made."

<a name="spiritualgifts"></a><h2>SPIRITUAL GIFTS.
</h2>
<p>In the churches established by our Savior and his apostles, the Holy
Ghost manifested itself in the development of a variety of gifts. Of so
great importance did the apostle Paul consider these gifts, to the well
being and edification of the Saints in Rome, that he wrote, "For I long
to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end
ye may be established;" <em>Rom</em>. 1. 11.
</p>
<p>The inspired writings do not indicate that these gifts were limited to
any period of time, or to any one dispensation, but they are spoken
of by the apostles, as ever characterizing the operations of the Holy
Spirit.
</p>
<p>In the twelfth chapter of the apostle Paul's first epistle to the
Corinthians, we are assured that "there are diversities of gifts by the
same spirit;" <em>verse</em> 4. "But the manifestation of the Spirit is given
to every man to profit withal;" <em>verse</em> 7. From this we learn that
the presence of the Spirit in a man is manifested by some gift. It is
evident from the general tenor of this chapter, that these gifts will
always be manifest in the church of Christ, for its members will ever
have the Holy Ghost abiding in them, and, where that is, the gifts of
the Spirit will be manifest.
</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon speaks very plainly of the necessity of these gifts
in the church. "Again I speak unto you, who deny the revelations of
God, and say that they are done away, that there are no revelations,
nor prophecies, nor gifts, nor healing, nor speaking with tongues, and
the interpretation of tongues. Behold I say unto you, he that denieth
these things, knoweth not the Gospel of Christ; yea, he has not read
the scriptures; if so, he does not understand them;" <em>Mormon</em> 9. 7, 8.
</p>
<p>In a revelation to Joseph, the prophet, given March 8, 1831, the Lord
gives much instruction concerning spiritual gifts; "For all have not
every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man
is given a gift by the Spirit of God;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 46. 11. The Lord
also adds, "That unto some it may be given to have all these gifts,
that there may be a head;" <em>verse</em> 29.
</p>

<a name="existence"></a><h2>PRE-EXISTENCE OF SPIRITS.
</h2>
<p>In the first chapter of Genesis, we have an account of six days, or
periods of time, which God occupied in the creation of this earth.
According to the traditions of many centuries, it is considered by the
Christian world a history of the creation of this earth, as it appears
now, naturally to men who dwell upon it.
</p>
<p>From the first and second chapters of Genesis, taken together, this
view of the subject is evidently erroneous. In the first verse of the
second chapter we read; "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished,
and all the host of them." This creation is evidently in a very
unfinished condition, for myriads of animal and vegetable life are
coming upon it and going to decay.
</p>
<p>The sacred writings not only testify that it is in a very imperfect
condition, but that it must pass away and be changed into a more
perfect earth.
</p>
<p>In the second and third verses of the second chapter, we learn that
there was a period of time called the seventh day, and that the Lord
sanctified it as a day of rest. If there has ever been a period of
time in which this earth, or its inhabitants, have had universal peace
and rest, since the progenitors of the race partook of the forbidden
fruit in the Garden of Eden, we have no account of it. "These are the
generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created,
in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens;" <em>verse</em>
4. This passage certainly states, that everything had been completed
in the period of time stated in the previous account. Verse five very
plainly states, in connection with the previous verse, that every plant
of the field was created, "Before it was in the earth, and every herb
of the field before it grew." During all this long period of time it
had not rained upon the earth. What is still more singular, it says,
"And there was not a man to till the ground."
</p>
<p>This Mosaic history of the creation was written for men in their
present temporal condition, and it is evident that these two verses
give us to understand, that these things had not taken place naturally
upon the earth, as they do now. As a sequence, when they did take
place, they would indicate a great change in the condition of the
earth. The first indication of this change is given in the sixth verse,
"There went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the
ground."
</p>
<p>Before the event mentioned in the seventh verse, the earth must have
been fitted up for the abode of man, in this his natural or temporal
condition. "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground,
and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life." That is, the
ground furnished the elements for the growth of the body of this first
temporal man; from its first conception, or germ, until it matured into
perfect manhood by a universal law.
</p>
<p>It should be noticed, that, in the first chapter, <em>verse</em> 27, it says,
"God created man." That is he organized from the spiritual elements,
the living, acting spiritual man. In the seventh verse of the second
chapter, it only states that he formed man out of the ground. That is
out of earthly elements he formed a tabernacle, a dwelling place for
the man whom he had before created. The prophet Joseph Smith, in his
translation of the Mosaic account of creation, fills up this gap, which
is so evident in the Bible Genesis, between the seventh day of rest,
and the formation of man from the dust of the ground.
</p>
<p>"For I, the Lord God, created all things, of which I have spoken,
spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth. For
I, the Lord God, had not caused it to rain upon the face of the earth.
And I, the Lord God, had created all the children of men; and not yet a
man to till the ground; for in heaven created I them; and there was not
yet flesh upon the earth; neither in the water, neither in the air; but
I, the Lord God, spake, and there went up a mist from the earth, and
watered the whole face of the ground. And I, the Lord God, formed man
from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath
of life; and man became a living soul, the first flesh upon the earth,
the first man also; nevertheless, all things were before created; but,
spiritually, were they created and made according to my word;" <em>P. of
G. P. page</em> 6.
</p>
<p>This account of the creation, plainly sets forth the comprehensive
fact, that all temporal organizations, pertaining to this earth, are
animated by spiritual pre-existent organizations. The following is a
very comprehensive passage on this subject: "When the Most High divided
to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam,
he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children
of Israel;" <em>Deut</em>. 32. 8. This passage certainly refers to a very
early period, when the heritage of the nations was given in proportion
to the numbers of Israel. It is difficult to conceive how their numbers
were then known unless there was a spiritual Israel, of which the
temporal is but the counterpart.
</p>
<p>The sacred writings abound with evidences that Jesus Christ controlled
the earth and ministered to man, as an organized spiritual intelligence
before he came in the flesh in the meridian of time. The first chapter
of John is very pointed on this subject: "In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God;" <em>verse</em> 1. "And
the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us;" <em>verse</em> 14.

<a name="Plurality"></a><h2>PLURALITY OF GODS.
</h2>
<p>The passages are numerous in the inspired writings which indicate a
plurality of Gods. In the account of creation, in the Book of Abraham,
the plural Gods is exclusively used; <em>P. of G. P. page</em> 33.
</p>
<p>The Psalmist, speaking of God, says: "Thou lovest righteousness, and
hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the
oil of gladness above thy fellows;" <em>Psalm</em> 45. 7. It is not possible
that any other than the true God is here referred to, for the God
that was anointed above his fellows had loved righteousness and hated
iniquity. "God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth
among the Gods;" 82. 1. In this passage the number of Gods among whom
God judgeth is indefinite, and the words, "congregation of the mighty,"
indicate that they might be quite numerous.
</p>
<p>John, the Evangelist, opens his history of our Savior thus; "In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God;" 1. 1. In this passage we have an account of two Gods, one of
which dwelt with the other in the beginning. That the "Word," spoken
of, is Jesus Christ is evident from <em>verse</em> 14: "And the Word was made
flesh, and dwelt among us."
</p>
<p>"Which in his times he shall shew, <em>who is</em> the blessed and only
Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of Lords;" 1 <em>Tim</em>. 6. 15. From
the context of this passage we learn that the kings and lords here
referred to were holy men. Of like significance is the following: "And
hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father;" <em>Rev</em>. 1. 6.
That is to God and the Father of God.
</p>
<p>"A Lamb stood on the Mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty <em>and</em>
four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads;"
14. 1. From the third verse we learn that these were redeemed from the
earth. Whether this name of the Father of Jesus Christ was God, or some
other title indicating his power and attributes, is not revealed to us,
but, whatever it was, it evidently identified those who received it as
Gods.

<a name="trueliving"></a><h2>THE TRUE AND LIVING GOD.
</h2>
<p>"There are two personages who constitute the great, matchless,
governing, and supreme, power over all things, by whom all things
were created and made, that are created and made, whether visible or
invisible, whether in heaven, on earth, or in the earth, under the
earth, or throughout the immensity of space.
</p>
<p>"They are the Father and the Son&mdash;the Father being a personage of
spirit, glory, and power, possessing all perfection and fulness, the
Son, who was in the bosom of the Father, a personage of tabernacle,
made or fashioned like unto man, or being in the form and likeness of
man, or rather man was formed after his likeness and in his image; he
is also the express image and likeness of the personage of the Father,
possessing all the fulness of the Father, or the same fulness with the
Father; being begotten of him, and ordained from before the foundation
of the world to be a propitiation for the sins of all those who should
believe on his name, and is called the Son because of the flesh, and
descended in suffering below that which man can suffer; or, in other
words, suffered greater sufferings, and was exposed to more powerful
contradictions than any man can be.
</p>
<p>"But, notwithstanding all this, he kept the law of God, and remained
without sin, showing thereby that it is in the power of man to keep
the law and remain also without sin; and also, that by him a righteous
judgment might come upon all flesh, and that all who walk not in the
law of God may justly be condemned by the law, and have no excuse for
their sins.
</p>
<p>"And he being the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace and
truth, and having overcome, received a fulness of the glory of the
Father, possessing the same mind with the Father, which mind is
the Holy Spirit, that bears record of the Father and the Son, and
these three are one; or, in other words, these three constitute the
great, matchless, governing and supreme, power over all things; by
whom all things were created and made that were created and made,
and these three constitute the Godhead, and are one; the Father and
Son possessing the same mind, the same wisdom, glory, power, and
fulness&mdash;filling all in all; the Son being filled with the fulness of
the mind, glory, and power; or, in other words, the Spirit, glory and
power, of the Father, possessing all knowledge and glory, and the same
kingdom, sitting at the right hand of power, in the express image and
likeness of the Father, mediator for man, being filled with the fulness
of the mind of the Father; or, in other words, the Spirit of the
Father, which Spirit is shed forth upon all who believe on his name and
keep his commandments; and all those who keep his commandments shall
grow up from grace to grace, and become heirs of the heavenly kingdom,
and joint heirs with Jesus Christ; possessing the same mind, being
transformed into the same image or likeness, even the express image of
him who fills all in all; being filled with the fulness of his glory,
and become one in him, even as the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are one.
</p>
<p>"From the foregoing account of the Godhead, which is given in his
revelations, the saints have a sure foundation laid for the exercise
of faith unto life and salvation, through the atonement and mediation
of Jesus Christ; by whose blood they have a forgiveness of sins, and
also a sure reward laid up for them in heaven, even that of partaking
of the fulness of the Father and the Son through the Spirit. As the
Son partakes of the fulness of the Father through the Spirit, so the
saints are, by the same Spirit, to be partakers of the same fulness,
to enjoy the same glory; for as the Father and the Son are one, so, in
like manner, the saints are to be one in them. Through the love of the
Father, the mediation of Jesus Christ, and the gift of the Holy Spirit,
they are to be heirs of God, and joint heirs with Jesus Christ;" <em>Doc.
&amp; Cov</em>., <em>Fifth Lecture on Faith</em>.
</p>
<p>"And now Abinadi said unto them, I would that ye should understand that
God himself shall come down among the children of men, and shall redeem
his people; and because he dwelleth in flesh, he shall be called the
Son of God: and having subjected the flesh to the will of the Father,
being the Father and the Son; the Father, because he was conceived by
the power of God; and the Son, because of the flesh; thus becoming the
Father and Son; and they are one God, yea, the very eternal Father of
heaven and earth;" <em>Mos</em>. 15. 1-4.
</p>
<p>"And shall be brought and be arraigned before the bar of Christ the
Son, and God the Father, and the Holy Spirit, which is one eternal God,
to be judged according to their works;" <em>Alma</em> 11. 44.
</p>
<p>"Behold, I am Jesus Christ the Son of God. I created the heavens and
the earth, and all things that in them are. I was with the Father from
the beginning. I am in the Father, and the Father in me; and in me hath
the Father glorified his name;" 3 <em>Nephi</em> 9. 15.
</p>
<p>"And after this manner shall ye baptize in my name, for behold, verily
I say unto you, that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are
one; and I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I
are one;" 3 <em>Nephi</em> 11. 27.
</p>
<p>"I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me,
and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me. * * And whoso
believeth in me, and is baptized, the same shall be saved; and they are
they who shall inherit the kingdom of God.
</p>
<p>"And whoso believeth not in me, and is not baptized, shall be damned.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and I bear
record of it from the Father; and whoso believeth in me, believeth in
the Father also, and unto him will the Father bear record of me; for he
will visit him with fire, and with the Holy Ghost.
</p>
<p>"And thus will the Father bear record of me, and the Holy Ghost will
bear record unto him of the Father and me; for the Father, and I, and
the Holy Ghost are one;" <em>verses</em> 32-36.
</p>
<p>"God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted Man, and sits
enthroned in yonder heavens! That is the great secret. If the vail was
rent to-day, and the Great God who holds this world in its orbit, and
who upholds all worlds and all things by his power, was to make himself
visible,&mdash;I say, if you were to see him to-day, you would see him like
a man in form&mdash;like yourselves in all the person, image, and very
form as a man; for Adam was created in the very fashion, image, and
likeness of God, and received instruction from, and walked, talked, and
conversed with him, as one man talks and communes with another;" <em>His.

<a name="passover"></a><h2>PASSOVER OR SACRAMENT.
</h2>
<p>"This word (passover) comes from the Hebrew verb, pasach, which
signifies to pass, to leap, or skip over. They gave the name of
Passover to the feast which was established in commemoration of the
coming forth out of Egypt, because the night before their departure,
the destroying angel, who slew the first-born of the Egyptians, passed
over the Israelites, because they were marked with the blood of the
lamb which was killed the evening before; and which for this reason was
called the Paschal Lamb;" <em>Cruden's Con</em>.
</p>
<p>We have an account of the institution of the Passover in the twelfth
chapter of Exodus. The Lord commanded Israel, saying, "And the day
shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to
the Lord throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an
ordinance for ever:" <em>verse</em> 14. This command rather implies that there
might be a change in the manner and time of keeping this passover, by
the house of Israel. The essential part of it is that it shall be kept
by a feast forever.
</p>
<p>That the passover, as instituted the evening before the departure of
Israel out of Egypt, was typical of the sacrifice of the Lamb of God,
appears to be the generally received opinion of all who have faith
in the Bible and its institutions. It is evident that the apostle
Paul entertained this view of the subject when he made the following
assertion, "For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us;" 1
<em>Cor</em>. 5. 7.
</p>
<p>That our Savior considered the ordinance of the passover a part of
the Mosaic law which was to be done away in his sufferings and death,
is evident from the wish, which he expressed to his disciples, while
keeping the passover with them the evening before his death, "With
desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer;"
<em>Luke</em> 22. 15. The type was no longer needed and the ordinance was
changed to commemorate the great sacrifice he was about to make.
Hence, he commanded his disciples to partake of the bread and wine in
remembrance of him.
</p>
<p>We cannot do better than to insert here, <em>verbatim</em>, the account of
the first administration of the sacrament among the Nephites, by our
Savior. "And it came to pass that Jesus commanded his disciples that
they should bring forth some bread and wine unto him. And while they
were gone for bread and wine, he commanded the multitude that they
should sit themselves down upon the earth."
</p>
<p>"And when the disciples had come with bread and wine, he took of the
bread, and brake and blessed it; and he gave unto the disciples, and
commanded that they should eat. And when they had eat, and were filled,
he commanded that they should give unto the multitude. And when the
multitude had eaten and were filled, he said unto the disciples, behold
there shall one be ordained among you, and to him will I give power
that he shall break bread, and bless it, and give it unto the people of
my church, unto all those who shall believe and be baptized in my name.
</p>
<p>"And this shall ye always observe to do, even as I have done, even as I
have broken bread, and blessed it, and gave it unto you. And this shall
ye do in remembrance of my body, which I have shewn unto you. And it
shall be a testimony unto the Father, that ye do always remember me.
And if ye do always remember me, ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.
</p>
<p>"And it came to pass that when he said these words, he commanded his
disciples that they should take of the wine of the cup, and drink of
it, and that they should also give unto the multitude, that they might
drink of it. And it came to pass that they did so, and did drink of it,
and were filled; and they gave unto the multitude, and they did drink,
and they were filled. And when the disciples had done this Jesus said
unto them, Blessed are ye for this thing which ye have done, for this
is fulfilling my commandment, and this doth witness unto the Father
that ye are willing to do that which I have commanded you. And this
shall ye always do to those who repent and are baptized in my name; and
ye shall do it in remembrance of my blood, which I have shed for you,
that ye may witness unto the Father that ye do always remember me. And
if ye do always remember me, ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.
And I give unto you a commandment that ye shall do these things. And if
ye shall always do these things, blessed are ye, for ye are built upon
my rock;" 3 <em>Nephi</em> 18. 1-12.

<a name="millennial"></a><h2>MILLENNIAL REIGN.
</h2>
<p>The inspired writings teach us that, at the second coming of Christ,
his reign of a thousand years, on the earth, will commence. A veritable
kingdom of the house of Israel will have been prepared to receive him.
</p>
<p>"The Son of man shall come down in heaven, clothed in the brightness of
his glory, to meet the kingdom of God which is set up on the earth;"
<em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 65. 5. The kingdom of God in heaven and on the earth will
then unite and constitute but one kingdom. "The kingdoms of this world
are become <em>the</em> kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall
reign for ever and ever;" <em>Rev</em>. 11. 15.
</p>
<p>Those that have part in the first resurrection, "Shall be priests of
God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years;" 20. 6.
</p>
<p>The earth will go through a purifying process to fit it for the
residence of its millennial inhabitants. "Behold, I create new heavens
and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered;" <em>Isa</em>. 65.
17. That this passage refers to the preparation for the millennium
is evident by the twentieth verse: "There shall be no more thence an
infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the
child shall die a hundred years old; but the sinner <em>being</em> a hundred
years old shall be accursed."
</p>
<p>This view of the subject is also presented to us in a revelation to
Joseph, the Seer: "Old things shall pass away, and all things become
new. * * * And he that liveth when the Lord shall come, and has kept
the faith, blessed is he; nevertheless it is appointed to him to die at
the age of man; wherefore children shall grow up until they become old,
old men shall die;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 63. 49-51.
</p>
<p>There are three conditions of the earth spoken of in the inspired
writings&mdash;the present, in which everything pertaining to it must go
through a change which we call death; the millennial condition in which
it will be sanctified for the residence of purer intelligences, some
mortal and some immortal, and the celestial condition spoken of in the
twenty-first and twenty-second chapters of Revelation, which will be
one of immortality and eternal life.
</p>
<p>When Christ's reign is fully established on the earth, there will be
two capitals to his immense empire&mdash;Jerusalem on the eastern hemisphere
and Zion on the western. "When the Lord of hosts shall reign in Mount
Zion, and in Jerusalem;" <em>Isa</em>. 24. 23. "For out of Zion shall go forth
the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem;" 2. 3.
</p>
<p>In this, "The fulness of times when Christ shall have subdued all
enemies under his feet, and shall have perfected his work, when he
shall deliver up the kingdom, and present it to the Father spotless,
then shall he be crowned with the crown of his glory, to sit on the
throne of his power to reign forever and ever;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>., 76.
106-108.
</p>
<p>The prophet Daniel speaks of this great event:
</p>
<p>"I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of Man came
with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they
brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and
glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should
serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not
pass away, and his kingdom <em>that</em> which shall not be destroyed;" 7. 13,
14. This passage evidences that Christ's reign on the earth will be
real and tangible; and that his kingdom will embrace a great variety of
nations and peoples, and that he is also subservient to his Father.
</p>
<p>The following passage, with its context, is a beautiful description of
the final coming of our Lord, and of his reign on the earth:
</p>
<p>"That my people may gird up their loins, and be looking forth for the
time of my coming; for there shall be my Tabernacle, and it shall be
called ZION, a New Jerusalem. And the Lord said unto Enoch, Then shalt
thou and all thy city meet them there and we will receive them into our
bosom, and they shall see us; and we will fall upon their necks, and
they shall fall upon our necks, and we will kiss each other; and there

<a name="Destruction"></a><h2>DESTRUCTION OF THE WICKED.
</h2>
<p>Passages are numerous in the inspired writings which assert that the
wicked shall be destroyed. The prophet Isaiah, speaking of the latter
times, says, "Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts
with righteousness. And the destruction of the transgressors and of
the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the Lord shall be
consumed;" 1. 27, 28.
</p>
<p>The Lord further declared through the same prophet, that, because the
inhabitants of the earth had defiled it, the curse had devoured it;
"And they that dwell therein are desolate;" 24. 5, 6. "For, behold, the
Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for
their iniquity;" 26. 21.
</p>
<p>Many of the sayings concerning the destruction of the wicked are
general in their application, to all times in which wickedness is
prevalent. But there are many passages in the inspired writings which
point to the latter times for a general destruction of the ungodly, and
the cleansing of the earth from wickedness.
</p>
<p>The following from Isaiah are of this character. "For the indignation
of the Lord is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies. *
* For it is the day of the Lord's vengeance, and the year of recompense
for the controversy of Zion;" 34. 2-8.
</p>
<p>"For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh: and
the slain of the Lord shall be many;" 66. 16.
</p>
<p>The Book of <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. being a record of revelations concerning
the dispensation of the fulness of times, it says much concerning the
destruction of the wicked, and the redemption of man, and of the earth.
</p>
<p>It is evident that the visions of the prophet Joseph were vivid and
well defined on this subject, for the Lord said through him, "The hour
is nigh, and the day soon at hand when the earth is ripe: and all the
proud, and they that do wickedly, shall be as stubble, and I will burn
them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that wickedness shall not be upon the
earth;" 29. 9, 14-21. <em>Sec</em>. 64. 24.
</p>
<p>The records of the times are a daily testimony of the fulfilment of the
following: "And in that day shall be heard of wars and rumors of wars,
and the whole earth shall be in commotion, and men's hearts shall fail
them;" <em>sec</em>. 45. 26. And men shall be standing in that generation in
which these things shall appear, "That shall not pass, until they shall
see an overflowing scourge; for a desolating sickness shall cover the
land;" <em>verse</em> 31.
</p>
<p>"Among the wicked, men shall lift up their voices, and curse God and
die. And there shall be earthquakes also in divers places, and many
desolations; yet men will harden their hearts against me, and they
will take up the sword, one against another, and they will kill one
another;" <em>verses</em> 32, 34.
</p>
<p>The testimony of the elders is the great preparatory work for the
destruction of the wicked in this dispensation. Their labors are "To
bind up the law and seal up the testimony, and to prepare the saints
for the hour of judgment which is to come;" <em>sec</em>. 88. 84. And, after
their testimony, "cometh wrath and indignation upon the people;"
<em>verse</em> 88.
</p>
<p>The testimonies that will follow the testimony of the elders are
fearful to contemplate: "For after your testimony cometh the testimony
of earthquakes, that shall cause groanings in the midst of her (the
earth), and men shall fall to the ground, and shall not be able to
stand. And also cometh the testimony of the voice of thunderings, and
the voice of lightnings, and the voice of tempests, and the voice of
the waves of the sea, heaving themselves beyond their bounds. And all
things shall be in commotion; and surely men's hearts shall fail them;
for fear shall come upon all people;" <em>sec</em>. 88. 89-91.
</p>
<p>These testimonies are becoming historical facts. The words of the
ancient prophets are being fulfilled. That Joseph Smith, Jun., saw and
predicted their fulfilment, evidences the divinity of his mission.

<a name="miracles"></a><h2>MIRACLES.
</h2>
<p>To mortal man the creation of the earth was a mysterious, miraculous
work. "God said let there be light and there was light." To the
uninspired the production of that light remains a supernatural
manifestation of power. From that time to this the Creator has been the
same wonder working God.
</p>
<p>The Mosaic dispensation opened up with mighty miracles in the land of
Egypt. To Israel, for fifteen hundred years, the Lord God was a God of
miracles.
</p>
<p>Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, well understood the power of the
Priesthood as manifested in the history of his fathers, when he said
to Jesus, "No man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be
with him;" <em>John</em> 3. 2.
</p>
<p>The Jews had faith in miracles as a witness that a man was sent of God.
"Many of the people believed on him, and said, when Christ cometh,
will he do more miracles than these which this <em>man</em> hath done?" 7.
31. The Gospel dispensation, like the Mosaic, which preceded it, was
one of miraculous manifestations. When Jesus sent out his disciples to
preach the Gospel he said to them, "Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers,
raise the dead, cast out devils; freely ye have received, freely give;"
<em>Matt</em>. 10. 8.
</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon evidences that the Mosaic dispensation, among
the Nephites, was also one of miraculous manifestations. The Gospel
dispensation, among them, was preceded and ushered in, by miraculous
wonders which involved the destruction of the wicked, and increased the
knowledge and faith of those who had the testimony of Jesus.
</p>
<p>We have the testimony of the writings of Moses, of the prophets, of
ancient Israel on both continents, of both Gospel dispensations as
recorded in the New Testament and Book of Mormon, that the God of
Israel, and of former day saints, was a God of miracles, of signs, and
wonders. We have the testimony of many thousands of Latter-day Saints,
that God manifests himself to them as he did to his people anciently.
</p>
<p>The Revelation of St. John assures us, that there will be many
miraculous manifestations of the power of God in the last days. The
sacred records everywhere evidence, that God is a God of miracles. No
people can claim to be saints of the Most High without the testimony of
miracles.
</p>
<p>At the same time there may be miraculous manifestations that are not
of God, for in the latter times one of the beasts which John saw, will
have power to do great wonders and deceive them that dwell on the
earth; <em>Rev</em>. 13. 13, 14.
</p>
<p>John also saw the spirits of devils working miracles; 16. 14. The
magicians worked miracles in common with Moses and Aaron, but Aaron's
rod swallowed up their rod. Thus it will ever be. The devil may have
great power over the elements, and over the hearts of men, but the Lord
will come off conqueror. The elect will never be deceived for they will
discern the difference between the two powers. Whoever is sent of God
will work miracles in the name of Jesus, and no man can work miracles
in the name of Jesus, "Save he were cleansed every whit from his
iniquity;" 3 <em>Nephi</em> 8. 1-3.
</p>
<p>There are two classes of miracles. One, manifesting the power of God
in the destruction of the wicked, the other a means of preserving,
blessing, and confirming the saints in the faith. If there be no faith
God can do no miracles; <em>Ether</em> 12. 12. The apostle Paul declared that
the power to work miracles was one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit;
1 <em>Cor</em>. 12. 10. Hence we may conclude that this gift will be ever
manifest where the Holy Ghost is conferred by the authority of the Holy
Priesthood.

<a name="jaredites"></a><h2>RECORDS OF THE JAREDITES.
</h2>
<p>The book of Ether, now forming a part of the Book of Mormon, is an
abridgment of the original book of Ether, the last historian of the
Jaredites. It was written by Moroni, during the period of thirty-six
years, between the destruction of his people at the great battle of
Cumorah, A. C. 384, and the time of closing up the Nephite records,
about A. C. 421.
</p>
<p>At the time of writing it, approximately one thousand years had passed
away since the people, of whom it gives a short account, were destroyed
by a civil war which was carried to the extreme of extermination.
</p>
<p>The account occupies about thirty-eight pages of the present edition
of the Book of Mormon. It can only be considered an outline sketch of
a people who occupied North America, probably a little over sixteen
hundred years.
</p>
<p>The Lord told the brother of Jared, the leader of this early American
colony, that "There shall be none greater than the nation which I will
raise up unto me of thy seed, upon all the face of the earth;" <em>Ether</em>
1. 43.
</p>
<p>We cannot doubt but what this prophetic blessing of the Lord upon them,
when they were about to commence their long and tedious journey from
the tower of Babel, was amply fulfilled.
</p>
<p>Their history informs us that they, in time, occupied the continent
from the Isthmus of Darien to the great lake on the north, and that the
states of their vast empire occupied the shores of both the eastern and
western oceans.
</p>
<p>Moroni says, "I take mine account from the twenty and four plates which
were found by the people of Limhi, which is called the Book of Ether;"
<em>Ether</em> 1. 2. Some account of the finding of these plates may be found
in <em>Mos</em>. 8. 8-11. <em>Chap</em>. 21. 25, 27.
</p>
<p>The fact that these plates were called the Book of Ether, after the
last prophet and historian of the Jaredites, indicates that they were
an abridgment from the general records of the Jaredites. The Book of
Ether bears the same relation to the general Jaredite records, that the
Book of Mormon does to those of the Nephites.
</p>
<p>Moroni states that he gives only a part of the account of the Jaredites
from the tower down to their destruction; <em>Ether</em> 1. 5. At the
completion of this record he says, "And the hundredth part I have not
written;" 15. 33. From these statements it is evident that the Book of
Ether, written by Moroni, is a very limited abridgment of the record of
Ether contained on the twenty-four plates.
</p>
<p>From the genealogy of Ether, given in the first chapter of the book, we
learn that he was the last of the royal line of the Jaredites, as well
as their last historian.
</p>
<p>In the days of the first Nephite king, called Mosiah, who reigned
in the land of Zarahemla, there was a stone brought to the city of
Zarahemla, on which was engraved a short account of the Jaredites;
<em>Omni</em> 1. 20-22.
</p>
<p>The twenty-four plates, and this stone, are the only original records
of the Jaredites of which we have any information. Moroni does not
appear to have made any use of this stone record in writing his
abridgment.
</p>
<p>We are informed, in the Book of Ether, that the twenty-four plates
contained the visions of the brother of Jared; 4. 4-7. Therefore we may
conclude, that they are in the sealed portion of the plates from which
the Book of Mormon was translated, by Joseph Smith, the Seer.
</p>
<p>There was, evidently, an original record from which Ether wrote his
account of the creation, and the history of the world down to the
tower. Probably this record is the one referred to by the daughter of
king Jared, when she asked her father if he had not read the record
which their fathers had brought across the great deep 8. 9.
</p>
<p>To the student who desires to dig deep, to learn the inspired history
of the earth and its inhabitants, this short account of a great people,
who occupied North America from about one hundred and twenty-five years
after the flood, until some 600 B. C., greatly increases the desire for
further information concerning them.

<a name="nephites"></a><h2>RECORDS OF THE NEPHITES.
</h2>
<p>The record of first importance to the Nephites was that of the plates
of brass, which was taken from the treasury of Laban by Nephi. It
contained the five books of Moses, the history of the Jews down to the
reign of Zedekiah, and a genealogy of the family of Lehi.
</p>
<p>This record was invaluable to the Jewish-American colony as a means of
perpetuating the religion, customs and civilization of their fathers.
Lehi prophesied, in his first camp in the wilderness, "That these
plates of brass should go forth unto all nations, kindreds, tongues,
and people who were of his seed;" 1 <em>Nephi</em> 5. 18. He further said
"That these plates of brass should never perish; neither should they be
dimmed any more by time;" <em>verse</em> 19.
</p>
<p>Nearly two thousand five hundred years have passed away since this
prophecy of Lehi's was recorded, and we are assured that these plates
of brass are well preserved, and are yet to come forth to all the
tribes and peoples of the aboriginal American race, and to all the race
of Lehi who may be scattered on the islands of the sea. This record,
on brass plates, was written in the Egyptian language; <em>Mos</em>. 1. 4. It
appears to have borne the same relationship to the Nephites, that the
Bible has to Christian nations, and to have been not only their guide
in religion, but also the foundation of their ethics and jurisprudence.
</p>
<p>From the first, Nephi was strongly impressed with the importance of
keeping a faithful record of his people. He says in the beginning
of his first book, "I make a record in the language of my father,
which consists of the learning of the Jews, and the language of the
Egyptians;" 1. 2. The Egyptian language must have had about the same
relation to the Jews, that the Latin has to modern Christian nations.
</p>
<p>The purpose of the Lord, in inspiring Nephi to make ample preparations
for keeping a record of his people, was gradually developed to him, for
he says in 9. 5, of his first book, "The Lord hath commanded me to make
these plates for a wise purpose in him; which purpose I know not."
</p>
<p>The importance of the future record of his people was afterwards shown
him in vision: "For behold, saith the Lamb, I will manifest myself unto
thy seed, that they shall write many things which I shall minister unto
them, which shall be plain and precious; and after thy seed shall be
destroyed, and dwindle in unbelief, and also the seed of thy brethren;
behold, these things shall be hid up, to come forth unto the Gentiles,
by the gift and power of the Lamb;" 13. 35. The remainder of this
chapter further explains this subject.
</p>
<p>By reading the third chapter of 2 <em>Nephi</em>, we learn that this subject
had become well developed in the mind of Lehi before his death.
Joseph, who was sold into Egypt, had left on record a remarkable
prophecy&mdash;which was probably engraven on the plates of brass&mdash;that
the writing of the fruit of his loins (the Book of Mormon), and the
writing of the fruit of the loins of Judah (the Bible), should not only
be joined together in the latter days, but that a great Seer should
be raised up who should write the writing of the fruit of his loins
for the benefit of his brethren. Such a plain description is given
of things connected with this Seer, that we are perfectly safe in
concluding that he and Joseph Smith, Jun., are identical.
</p>
<p>From this time, during the existence of the Nephites, the coming forth
of their record to the Lamanites, and to their own posterity in the
latter times, was ever associated in the minds of the faithful, with
the Seer whom the Lord should raise up to bring them forth. Both were
the subject of their earnest prayers, and called forth the exercise of
a living faith; <em>Mormon</em>, 8. 25.
</p>
<p>The history of the Nephite-American colony commences with their leaving
Jerusalem, 600 B. C.; 1 <em>Nephi</em> 10. 4, and closed when Moroni finished
the record, from which the Book of Mormon was translated, and hid it up
in the hill Cumorah, A. C. 421; a period of one thousand and twenty-one
years.
</p>
<p>When Lehi and his colony left Jerusalem, the renowned city of Babylon
was in the height of its glory, and the city of Rome had been founded
only one hundred and fifty years.
</p>
<p>The importance of the Book of Mormon, as a history, will be recognized
by the fact that it is the only history of the western hemisphere,
known to the world, for the long period of thirty-eight hundred years
between Noah's flood, and the discovery of America by Christopher
Columbus, in 1492.

<a name="visionsdreams"></a><h2>VISIONS AND DREAMS.
</h2>
<p>"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto
his servants the prophets;" <em>Amos</em> 3. 7. "Where there is no vision the
people perish;" <em>Prov</em>. 29. 18.
</p>
<p>By visions and dreams the Lord has made known his will to his people,
in every dispensation of the Priesthood. This method of communicating
information, in its operations, is beyond the comprehension of our
natural powers, and, for this reason, ranks among the supernatural.
</p>
<p>In the past, the Lord has made known to his prophets many of the
important events that were to become history, down through the
centuries of coming time.
</p>
<p>In the writings of Moses, as revealed to Joseph, the Seer, we have an
account of wonderful things, made known in this way, to the prophet
Enoch, who lived several hundred years before Noah's flood. He says:
"As I was journeying, and stood in the place Mahujah, and cried unto
the Lord, there came a voice out of heaven, saying, Turn ye, and get ye
upon the mount Simeon.
</p>
<p>"And it came to pass that I turned and went up on the mount; and as I
stood upon the mount, I beheld the heavens open, and I was clothed upon
with glory, and I saw the Lord; and he stood before my face, and he
talked with me, even as a man talketh one with another, face to face;
and he said unto me, Look, and I will show unto thee the world for the
space of many generations." When we reflect that this great prophet
lived nearly five thousand years ago, and that the Lord revealed to him
the great events that were to take place on the earth until the coming
of Christ in the latter-days, it will give us some little comprehension
of the wonderful and great things revealed to him. The account of this
is in <em>P. of G. P., pages</em> 17-22.
</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon gives us a short account of another prophet, the
brother of Jared, who lived about one hundred years after the flood.
The Lord "Shewed unto the brother of Jared all the inhabitants of the
earth which had been, and also all that would be; and he withheld them
not from his sight, even unto the ends of the earth; For he had said
unto him in times before, That if he would believe in him, that he
could shew unto him all things&mdash;it should be shewn unto him; therefore
the Lord could not withhold anything from him, for he knew that the
Lord could shew him all things."
</p>
<p>We have no account of any greater vision than this which the brother
of Jared had. "And the Lord said unto him, Write these things and seal
them up, and I will shew them in mine own due time unto the children
of men;" <em>Ether</em> 3. 2-27. Thus we learn from the twenty-seventh verse,
that all the great things which pertain to the history of man, from the
beginning unto the end of the earth, are yet to be revealed, through
the record of the brother of Jared, to all who are prepared to receive
them.
</p>
<p>Lehi, the head of the first Jewish colony to America, was commanded by
the Lord, in a dream, to leave Jerusalem, take his family and go into
the wilderness, preparatory to going to a strange land; 1 <em>Nephi</em> 2.
2; <em>verse</em> 4 proves his supreme faith in this dream: "And it came to
pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and
the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his
precious things, and took nothing with him, save it were his family,
and provisions, and tents, and departed into the wilderness."
</p>
<p>This great patriarch, on other occasions, showed his faith in dreams
and visions. In these ways the Lord revealed many great things to him
and his son Nephi.
</p>
<p>The Mosaic dispensation opened by an angel of the Lord appearing unto
Moses in a flame of fire "Out of the midst of a bush;" <em>Exo</em>. 3. 2.
</p>
<p>The Old Testament gives an account of many visions and dreams,
but perhaps the most important of the latter is the dream of
Nebuchadnezzar, which was interpreted by the prophet Daniel; <em>Dan</em>.
2. It is now over twenty-four hundred years since the king of Babylon
had that dream, and its fulfilment can be traced in the history of the
world down through all these centuries.
</p>
<p>The last great event, shown in this dream, was, that in the latter
times the God of heaven would set up a kingdom which would break down
other kingdoms and stand forever. This is the kingdom that it was the
mission of Joseph Smith, Jun., to establish, and which the Latter-day
Saints are laboring to build up.
</p>
<p>Dreams characterized the opening up of the New Testament dispensation.
After the birth of our Savior the wise men, who came from the east to
see him, were warned to disobey the command of the wicked king Herod,
who sought the life of the young child. The reputed father of the
child, Joseph, was warned in a dream to take the child and its mother
and flee into Egypt for the same reason. When Herod was dead, Joseph
was warned in a dream to take the child and its mother and return into
the land of Israel.
</p>
<p>This great latter-day dispensation was opened up by a vision. When
Joseph Smith, Jun., was a lad, in his fifteenth year, he retired to a
secret place to ask the Lord to direct him and give him wisdom. When he
kneeled down to offer up the desires of his heart to God, he was nearly
overcome by the powers of darkness.
</p>
<p>He says, in the narrative of his life written by himself, "Just at this
moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head,
above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it
fell upon me. It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from
the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me, I saw two
personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing
above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name, and
said (pointing to the other), THIS IS MY BELOVED SON, HEAR HIM." <em>P. of
G. P., page</em> 47.
</p>
<p>An account of one of the most remarkable visions of this dispensation,
is recorded in <em>Doc. &amp; Cov., sec</em>. 76. The narrative commences as
follows: "We, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, being in the
Spirit on the sixteenth of February, in the year of our Lord, one
thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, by the power of the Spirit our
eyes were opened and our understandings were enlightened, so as to see
and understand the things of God&mdash;even those things which were from
the beginning before the world was, which were ordained of the Father,
through his Only Begotten Son, who was in the bosom of the Father, even
from the beginning, of whom we bear record, and the record which we
bear is the fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, who is the Son, whom
we saw and with whom we conversed in the heavenly vision;" <em>verses</em>
11-14. In Joseph Smith's first vision, God the Father bore testimony of
Jesus Christ his Son. In this last vision, the Son appeared to Joseph
Smith and Sidney Rigdon, and revealed to them many great and glorious
truths concerning the resurrection, and the final reward of all men
according to their works. The account of the vision will repay much
careful study.
</p>
<p>The Lord said, through his prophet Joel, speaking of the times when
Israel should be gathered in the latter days, "I will pour out my
Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions;" 2.
28. Thousands of Latter-day Saints can testify that this prophecy is
being fulfilled, and that dreams and visions characterize this as they
have all former dispensations of the Priesthood.

<a name="signstokens"></a><h2>SIGNS AND TOKENS.
</h2>
<p>Signs may or may not be miraculous manifestations. They may indicate
something that has taken place, and also be a token of a continuance of
some certain blessing. For instance, the Lord covenanted with Noah, and
with every living creature, that he would not again destroy all flesh
from the earth with a flood.
</p>
<p>As a token of this covenant the Lord said to Noah, "I do set my bow in
the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the
earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth,
that the bow shall be seen in the cloud." The Lord further assured
Noah, "And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that
I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living
creature of all flesh that is upon the earth;" <em>Gen</em>. 9. 9-17.
</p>
<p>They may also indicate that certain things shall take place
periodically, as "God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the
heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and
for seasons, and for days, and for years;" 1. 14.
</p>
<p>The prophets have foretold signs that should precede great events that
were to take place on the earth. Speaking of the birth of our Savior,
the prophet Isaiah says, "The Lord himself shall give you a sign;
Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son;" 7. 14.
</p>
<p>The Lamanite prophet, Samuel, foretold to the Nephites in the city
of Zarahemla, that for two days and one night preceding the birth of
Christ there should be no darkness, and that a new star should arise,
such an one as the Nephites had never before beheld; <em>Hel</em>. 14. 3, 5.
These signs appeared as Samuel predicted; 3 <em>Nephi</em> 1. 13-21.
</p>
<p>He also predicted terrible judgments that should destroy the wicked
among the Nephites and Lamanites when the Savior should die.
Simultaneously with that event there should be thunderings, lightnings,
tempests and earthquakes. These should continue for many hours, and
darkness should cover the land for three days; <em>Hel</em>. 14. 21-27.
<em>Chapters</em> 8, 9, and 10, of 3 <em>Nephi</em>, give us a very vivid description
of these judgments that were predicted by Samuel.
</p>
<p>In the sacred writings, many signs are predicted that should precede
the coming of the Son of Man, in the latter days. The Jewish apostles
of our Savior manifested great interest in this matter. On a certain
occasion when Jesus sat upon the Mount of Olives, they asked concerning
the destruction of Jerusalem; after which they especially inquired,
"What is the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world?" <em>P. of G.
P., page</em> 38.
</p>
<p>Jesus first answered them concerning the destruction of the Temple
and the Jews. He told his disciples that they should be afflicted and
killed, and be hated of all nations for his name's sake. "Then shall
many be offended, and shall betray one another; and many false prophets
shall arise, and shall deceive many; and because iniquity shall abound,
the love of many shall wax cold; but he that remaineth steadfast and is
not overcome, the same shall be saved."
</p>
<p>"When you, therefore, shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken
of by Daniel the prophet, concerning the destruction of Jerusalem
(<em>Dan</em>. 12. 11), then you shall stand in the holy place." In this
paragraph, continuing on to <em>page</em> 39, Christ says, "In those days,
shall be great tribulation on the Jews, and upon the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, such as was not before sent upon Israel of God, since the
beginning of their kingdom until this time; no, nor ever shall be sent
again upon Israel."
</p>
<p>After these judgments should come upon Jerusalem and the Jews, then
false Christs and prophets should arise, and shew great signs and
wonders, insomuch that they would deceive the Elect according to the
covenant, if it were possible.
</p>
<p>Then he assures his disciples that they shall hear of wars and rumors
of wars, but he assures them that will not be the end. For afterwards
there will be those who will predict the coming of the Son of Man. He
tells his disciples that they need not be deceived with regard to this
great event, "For as the light of the morning cometh out of the east,
and shineth even unto the west, and covereth the whole earth, so shall
also the coming of the Son of Man be." That is, the indications of his
coming will be so unmistakable that they need not be deceived.
</p>
<p>One very significant sign of his coming, he stated would be, that his
Elect should be gathered from the four quarters of the earth. Through
the instrumentality of Joseph Smith and the Holy Priesthood, this
great work is now going on: "And they," that is those who are being
gathered, "shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars, * * for nation
shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there shall be
famine, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places; and again,
(for the second time) because iniquity shall abound, the love of many
shall wax cold." Again Jesus gave the assurance that he who was not
overcome should be saved: "And again"&mdash;that is when the Elect are being
gathered and judgments were being poured out upon the nations for the
second time&mdash;"This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
world, for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come,"
or the destruction of the wicked; "and again"&mdash;that is for the second
time&mdash;"shall the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the
prophet, be fulfilled. And immediately after the tribulation of those
days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven shall
be shaken; verily, I say unto you, this generation, in which these
things shall be shewn forth, shall not pass away until all I have told
you shall be fulfilled. * * * After the tribulation of those days,
and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken; then shall appear the
sign of the Son of Man in heaven, and then shall all the tribes of the
earth mourn; and they shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of
heaven, with power and great glory;" <em>P. of G. P., pages</em> 38-40.
</p>
<p>This translation of the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew, commencing
with the last verse of the twenty-third chapter, by Joseph Smith,
the Seer, is both very interesting and instructive to the student of
theology. It contains much more than can be made to appear in a short
sketch like this.
</p>
<p>Every dispensation of the Priesthood has been characterized by
miracles, by signs, and wonders, and none more than this, the
dispensation of the fulness of times. It was to be opened up by
an angel who should fly through the midst of heaven, having the
everlasting Gospel to preach to the nations of the earth; <em>Rev</em>. 14. 6.
</p>
<p>An angel, named Moroni, has come and brought forth to the world the
Book of Mormon, which contains the fulness of the everlasting Gospel;
<em>P. of G. P., pages</em> 49-53. It is the same Gospel that was preached
by Jesus and his apostles. Thus, the saying of the Savior to his
disciples upon the Mount of Olives is being fulfilled: "This Gospel of
the kingdom shall be preached to all the world for a witness unto all
nations; and then shall the end come;" <em>Matt</em>. 24. 14. Israel is being
gathered from the four quarters of the earth in fulfilment of numerous
predictions of the ancient prophets.
</p>
<p>Jesus, also, told his disciples that they should hear of wars and
rumors of wars. "For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom
against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and
earthquakes, in divers places;" <em>verses</em> 6, 7. The world is witness
that these sayings are being fulfilled.
</p>
<p>These are only a few of the many signs and tokens that the coming
of the Son of Man in power and great glory is near at hand. Signs
and tokens will increase as manifestations that God is at work among
the nations. Only those who have faith in God will comprehend their
meaning. He has promised his saints that it should be given them to
understand the signs of the times; <em>Doc &amp; Cov</em>. 68. 11.
</p>
<p>The wicked are ever seeking after signs, but they have no faith in the
Giver, and therefore their motives are evil. Jesus said, "An evil and
adulterous generation seeketh after a sign;" <em>Matt</em>. 12. 39. We are
promised that signs shall follow the believer; <em>Mark</em> 16. 17-20. This
promise is not limited to any specified time or place; but extends to
all believers. They are nowhere promised to the unbeliever except for a
testimony against them; for the Lord has said, "He that seeketh signs,
shall see signs, but not unto salvation;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>., 63. 7.
</p>
<p>Signs are a gift of God, and, to be beneficial to those who receive
them, they must come by faith; "Signs come by faith, not by the will of
men, nor as they please, but by the will of God;" <em>verse</em> 10. Hence,
they are a blessing to the believer, but not to those who would treat
with contempt a manifestation of the power and goodness of God.

<a name="Angels"></a><h2>ANGELS.
</h2>
<p>Angels have acted an important part in every dispensation of the
Priesthood. An angel first preached the Gospel of faith on the Son
of God to Adam; <em>P. of G. P., page</em> 9. An angel of the Lord called
to Abraham; <em>Gen</em>. 22. 11. An angel first attracted the attention
of Moses to the burning bush; <em>Ex</em>. 3. 2. Their ministrations are
often mentioned in the Old Testament history of ancient Israel. They
were a prominent feature in the opening history of the New Testament
dispensation. An angel appeared to Zacharias, the father of John the
Baptist, and foretold his birth; <em>Luke</em> 1. 11, 12.
</p>
<p>The angel Gabriel appeared to the virgin Mary and foretold the birth of
the Savior; <em>verse</em> 31. An angel appeared to the shepherds, bringing
the joyful news of a Savior's birth; 2. 10, 11. One warned Joseph to
flee into Egypt to save the life of the child Jesus, and to return
again after the death of Herod; <em>Matt</em>. 2. 13-15. According to the
writings of the apostles they continued their ministrations, at least
until John wrote his Revelation, for he was commanded to write to the
angel of each of the seven churches of Asia; <em>Chapters</em> 2. 3.
</p>
<p>According to prophecy, angels were to act an important part in the
dispensation of the fulness of times. The dispensation was to be opened
by one, for John the Revelator says, "And I saw another angel fly in
the midst of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to preach unto them
that dwell on the earth;" <em>Rev</em>. 14. 6.
</p>
<p>There is abundant evidence that an angel, calling himself Moroni,
came to Joseph Smith, Jun., and taught him the principle and power of
revelation from God, made known to him the real condition of the world,
and when he had properly instructed him, delivered to him the record
from which the Book of Mormon was translated by the power of God,
containing the fulness of the everlasting Gospel; <em>P. of G. P., pages</em>
49-54.
</p>
<p>The angel, John the Baptist, ordained Joseph Smith and O. Cowdery to
the Priesthood of Aaron, "Which holds the keys of <em>the ministering of
angels</em>, and of the Gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion
for the remission of sins;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>., 13. From this second angel
they received authority to preach the Gospel, revealed by the first
angel, and to minister in its ordinances among all nations, thus
fulfilling the prophetic vision of St. John.
</p>
<p>Angels are to accompany Jesus Christ when he shall come in the glory of
his Father; <em>Matt</em>. 16. 27. They are to gather the elect from the four
quarters of the earth; 24. 31. The inspired writings, and especially
the Revelation of St. John, assures us that they will act an important
part in the great work of the latter days. There can be no truly Gospel
church in which their ministrations are not recognized.

<a name="sabbath"></a><h2>THE SABBATH DAY.
</h2>
<p>In the history of creation, as given in the Bible Genesis, we find that
the Lord commenced and ended the labor of creating the world in six
days or periods of time. That also, he ceased his labors on the seventh
day and devoted it to rest.
</p>
<p>As we have shown in the article on pre-existence, in this work, these
seven periods of creative time were occupied in the creation and
perfection of spiritual organizations. These have since given life to
the organizations formed out of the crude elements, from which all
animal and vegetable life is formed.
</p>
<p>When Adam was formed out of these elements, and the Lord made every
tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food, to grow
out of the ground, another series of creative days, or periods of
time, commenced. The six days of labor, which, according to present
reckoning, is supposed to be about six thousand years, has nearly
passed away.
</p>
<p>The Christian world anticipate the time when antagonisms will cease,
and there will be a time of universal peace, called the Millennium.
While the Christian sects may entertain various theories as to how
this millennium will be brought about, and what will be its practical
results, to the Latter-day Saints it assumes a well defined outline, as
delineated in the sacred books.
</p>
<p>Typical of these great, creative sabbaths, the Lord has commanded man
to rest every seventh day, according to his reckoning, as measured by
one revolution of the earth on its axis. The sabbath was instituted for
man's especial benefit, for the Savior, when on the earth, declared
that "The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath;"
<em>Mark</em> 2. 27.
</p>
<p>There is nothing to indicate that the sabbath was a new institution at
the time Israel came out of Egypt, but, being the beginning of a new
dispensation, the institution was strengthened by direct commandment.
In about one month after their deliverance from Egypt, when the Lord
had commenced to feed them on manna, they were commanded to gather
on the sixth day enough for the seventh day also. This obviated
the necessity of gathering food on the sabbath, for the Lord said,
"To-morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the Lord;" <em>Exo</em>. 16.
23.
</p>
<p>In the third month after Israel came out of Egypt, amidst a wonderful
display of his glory and power upon Mount Sinai, the Lord gave to
Israel ten commandments, one of which was, "Remember the sabbath day,
to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but
the seventh is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not
do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor
thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy
gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and
all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord
blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it;" 20. 8-11. This commandment
is very sweeping and comprehensive, and the Lord makes it typical of
the creative, sabbatic period of time.
</p>
<p>In the Pentateuch the passages are quite numerous in which the children
of Israel are reminded of the importance of keeping this commandment.
The importance of keeping the sabbath day holy is urged upon Israel in
the following passage, if possible, with still more force than in the
Decalogue: "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto
the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for
it is a SIGN between me and you throughout your generations; that ye
may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you;" 31. 12-18.
</p>
<p>A very important feature of this subject is expressed in the last
verse. The keeping of the sabbath day was to be a <em>sign</em> throughout the
generations of Israel, that the people continually remembered that it
was the Lord that sanctified them through keeping his commandments.
</p>
<p>In <em>verse</em> 14, the Lord says, "Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for
it is holy unto you. Every one that defileth it shall surely be put to
death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off
from among his people." The command is repeated in a little different
form in <em>verse</em> 15.
</p>
<p>The sabbath was to be a perpetual covenant between the Lord and the
children of Israel. "Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the
sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a
perpetual covenant;" <em>verse</em> 16. In <em>verse</em> 17 they are commanded to
observe it as a sign that they remember that the Lord made heaven and
earth, and rested on the seventh day.
</p>
<p>In these quotations from <em>Exo</em>. 31, and in the Decalogue the most
positive and weighty reasons are given by the Lord to the fathers of
the house of Israel, for keeping the sabbath day. The obligation is
evidently as binding upon the Latter-day Saints as it was upon their
fathers, and they in like manner will reap the reward of obedience.
</p>
<p>Israel was also required to give the land rest. "Six years thou shalt
sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather
in the fruit thereof; but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of
rest unto the land, a sabbath for the Lord: thou shalt neither sow thy
field, nor prune thy vineyard;" <em>Lev</em>. 25. 3, 4. After seven sabbaths
of years had been numbered, making forty-nine years, then the fiftieth
year was to be a year of Jubilee. This was a year of general release
from all bondage. "And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim
liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it
shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his
possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family;" <em>verse</em>
10. Both the forty-ninth and fiftieth were years of rest for the land.
This chapter should be well studied for information with regard to the
sabbatic year.
</p>
<p>The Lord, in his revelations through his prophet Joseph, has commanded
the saints to keep the sabbath day holy. "For verily this is a day
appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions
unto the Most High. * * * And on this day thou shalt do none other
thing, only let thy food be prepared with singleness of heart that
thy fasting may be perfect, or, in other words, that thy joy may be
full;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>., 59. 10, 13. In <em>verse</em> 15-17, great blessings are
promised as the result of keeping this commandment. To keep the sabbath
holy is again positively enjoined upon the saints "And the inhabitants
of Zion shall, also, observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy;" <em>Sec</em>.

<a name="Israel"></a><h2>ISRAEL A CHOSEN PEOPLE.
</h2>
<p>The name, Israel, is used to designate the descendants of Abraham
through Isaac his son, and Jacob his grandson. The Lord gave the name
to Jacob the father of twelve sons, the heads of the tribes of Israel.
"And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-aram, and
blessed him. And God said unto him, thy name is Jacob: thy name shall
not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; and he
called his name Israel;" <em>Gen</em>. 35. 9, 10.
</p>
<p>Abraham was a direct descendant of Shem, the son of Noah, and his
native land was Ur of the Chaldees; <em>chap</em>. 11. "Now the Lord said unto
Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy
father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee: and I will make of
thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great;
and thou shalt be a blessing: and I will bless them that bless thee,
and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the
earth be blessed;" 12. 1-3.
</p>
<p>The promise to Abram, that he should become a great nation, has been
fulfilled in his chosen seed occupying the land of Palestine, as such,
for fifteen hundred years. It will again be fulfilled when they become
a nation on that land forever.
</p>
<p>The history of the eastern hemisphere for the two thousand years
which intervened between the calling of Abraham and the destruction
of Jerusalem by the Romans, witnesses that every nation that fought
against Israel, or in any way oppressed them, passed away. Time will
show the same general result, from the destruction of Jerusalem to the
millennium.
</p>
<p>The prophet Isaiah, speaking of the time when the Lord should favor
Israel, said, "All they that were incensed against thee shall be
ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive
with thee shall perish;" 41. 11. "I will feed them that oppress thee
with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood;"
49. 26. "I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even the
dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again: but I
will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to
thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over;" 51. 22, 23.
</p>
<p>The first Nephi saw the final result, as between Israel and their
enemies, some six hundred years before the birth of our Savior.
Speaking of the time when they should be brought out of captivity, and
gathered to the lands of their inheritance, he says, "And the blood of
that great and abominable church, which is the whore of all the earth,
shall turn upon their own heads; for they shall war among themselves,
and the sword of their own hands shall fall upon their own heads, and
they shall be drunken with their own blood. And every nation which
shall war against thee, O house of Israel, shall be turned one against
another, and they shall fall into the pit which they digged to ensnare
the people of the Lord;" 1 <em>Nephi</em> 22. 13, 14.
</p>
<p>The sacred and profane history of the world evidences that all people,
outside of the covenant seed of Abraham, when brought into association
with that seed, have exhibited an instinctive antagonism to them. As a
result, there are few nations that have not oppressed them, when there
has been opportunity.
</p>
<p>The quotations made on this subject, and many more not noticed, show
that Israel will rule over all these in the future. As a result
the future princes of the earth will be of that lineage. Then will
be fulfilled another very important promise which the Lord made to
Abraham: "Thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;" <em>Gen</em>. 22.
17.
</p>
<p>The promise in the following, <em>verse</em> 18, which is also repeated in a
number of places in the sacred writings, is a very important one: "In
thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed." It was through
the lineage of Abraham that Jesus came in the flesh to redeem the
world. It was only to the seed of Abraham that he personally ministered
while in the flesh.
</p>
<p>He was born in Bethlehem of Judea, almost under the walls of Jerusalem;
<em>Luke, chap</em>. 2. He grew up in Nazareth, a city of Galilee; <em>verse</em>
39. He was baptized in Jordan, the chief river of the land of promise;
<em>Matt</em>. 3. 13. His chosen twelve disciples were of the house of Israel.
They were sent first to preach the Gospel to the house of Israel:
"These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into
the way of Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:
but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel;" <em>Matt</em>. 10. 5,
6.
</p>
<p>All the labors of Christ's earthly mission were in the midst of Israel.
Among them he was slain for the sins of the world; his body was laid in
a tomb cut in the rock of the promised land; in the midst of those with
whose fathers he had covenanted he ascended up to his Father.
</p>
<p>After his resurrection he told his disciples that Christ must needs
suffer and rise from the dead, "That repentance and remission of
sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at
Jerusalem;" <em>Luke</em> 24. 47.
</p>
<p>So necessary did Jesus consider it, that the blessings and power of the
Gospel should go forth to the world from the house of Israel, that just
before his ascension he commanded his disciples, "Tarry ye in the city
of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high;" <em>verse</em> 49.
</p>
<p>Jesus once said to his Jewish disciples, "Other sheep I have, which are
not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice;
and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd;" <em>John</em> 10. 16. While
ministering among the Nephites, after his resurrection, he told them
what he had said to his disciples at Jerusalem, and also that they were
the other sheep which he referred to.
</p>
<p>He further said to the Nephites, "And they (that is his disciples
at Jerusalem) understood me not, for they supposed it had been the
Gentiles; for they understand not that the Gentiles should be converted
through their preaching; * * and they understand me not that the
Gentiles should not at any time hear my voice; that I should not
manifest my self unto them, save it were by the Holy Ghost. But behold,
ye have both heard my voice, and seen me;" 3 <em>Nephi</em> 15. 22-24.
</p>
<p>In another place the Lord told the Nephites how the promise to Abraham,
"In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed," would be
fulfilled. "And after that ye were blessed, then fulfilleth the Father
the covenant which he made with Abraham, saying, in thy seed shall all
the kindreds of the earth be blessed, unto the pouring out of the Holy
Ghost through me upon the Gentiles;" 20. 27.
</p>
<p>Thus we are assured that Jesus never has ministered in person to the
Gentiles, and there are no promises for the future to them which
involve such administration. In this dispensation, all the blessings
of the everlasting Gospel have been restored to the earth, through
the agency of the house of Israel. Of them a people will be prepared,
and through them a kingdom will be established, over which the Savior
will reign on the earth. Then Israel will be the head of nations, and
the promise made to Abraham, "Thy seed shall possess the gate of his
enemies," will fully be realized.

<a name="prison"></a><h2>SPIRITS IN PRISON.
</h2>
<p>The writings of every dispensation of the Priesthood evidence that
the Creator provided a place of confinement or retention, where
intelligences await future events concerning themselves.
</p>
<p>Several hundred years before the flood, the Lord, speaking to Enoch
concerning the wicked, said: "Behold, these which thine eyes are upon
shall perish in the floods; and behold, I will shut them up; a prison
have I prepared for them;" <em>P. of G. P., page</em> 20.
</p>
<p>The idea of a pit or prison for man, appears to have been quite
definite in the mind of Job; speaking of God's dealings with man,
he says, "He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from
perishing by the sword;" 33. 18.
</p>
<p>The Psalmist David called this place hell or place of departed spirits,
for he said of the Lord, "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell;" <em>Psalm</em>
16. 10. The latter part of the passage evidences that he was looking
forward to the resurrection of Christ, to open the way for his release,
"Neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption."
</p>
<p>Speaking of the latter times, the Lord said, through the prophet
Isaiah, "Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant
of the earth. * * * And it shall come to pass in that day, that the
LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the
kings of the the earth upon the earth. And they shall be gathered
together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up
in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited;" 24. 17, 21,
22. This passage from Isaiah is very definite on this subject. The
assertion, "After many days shall they be visited," certainly infers
that a time would come when they might be released.
</p>
<p>The Lord speaking of another person says, "I the <em>Lord</em> have called
thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee,
and will give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the
Gentiles." The following verse shows that the Lord would call and
keep this servant of his for a special work, and that was, "To open
the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them
that sit in darkness out of the prison house;" 42. 6, 7. This passage
explains how those who would be gathered as prisoners into the pit, and
be shut up in prison, were to be visited after many days. Of similar
import is <em>Isa</em>. 49. 5-9.
</p>
<p>The apostle Peter was evidently quite familiar with this subject: "For
Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust,
that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but
quickened by the Spirit: by which also he went and preached unto the
spirits in prison; which sometime were disobedient, when once the
long suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was
a preparing;" 1 <em>Pet</em>. 3. 18-20. The Nephite, as well as the Jewish
prophets, speak of a place of confinement for spirits; "Wherefore,
death and hell must deliver up their dead, and hell must deliver up its
captive spirits, and the grave must deliver up its captive bodies, and
the bodies and the spirits of men will be restored one to the other;" 2
<em>Nephi</em> 9. 12.
</p>
<p>These spirits, which are delivered from hell, are not the spirits of
the righteous, for, in the thirteenth verse of the same chapter, the
prophet says, "For on the other hand, the paradise of God must deliver
up the spirits of the righteous."
</p>
<p>These passages show us that the spirits of the wicked go to a prison,
or hell, and the spirits of the righteous to the paradise of God, a
place of light and freedom. Doubtless it was the same paradise which
Jesus referred to, when he said to the thief on the cross, "To-day
shall thou be with me in paradise;" <em>Luke</em> 23. 43.
</p>
<p>The Lord said, in a revelation to the prophet Joseph, "I am the same
which have taken the Zion of Enoch into mine own bosom; and verily,
I say, even as many as have believed in my name. * * * But behold,
the residue of the wicked have I kept in chains of darkness until the
judgment of the great day, which shall come at the end of the earth;
and even so will I cause the wicked to be kept, that will not hear my
voice but harden their hearts;" <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>. 38. 4-6.
</p>
<p>This subject is still more fully explained in another revelation,
through Joseph, the Seer. After the Lord instructed him concerning the
first resurrection he says, "And after this another angel shall sound,
which is the second trump; and then cometh the redemption of those who
are Christ's at his coming; who have received their part in that prison
which is prepared for them, that they might receive the Gospel, and
be judged according to men in the flesh;" 88. 99. This verse informs
us that when Christ comes there will be a class of spirits who will
be redeemed from prison, because they will have paid the penalty of
transgression, and will have accepted the Gospel which will have been
preached to them in prison.
</p>
<p>After the spirits who are prepared for redemption shall be brought out
of prison by the resurrection, then "Another trump shall sound, which
is the third trump; and then cometh the spirits of men who are to be
judged, and are found under condemnation. And these are the rest of
the dead, and they live not again until the thousand years are ended,
neither again, until the end of the earth;" <em>verses</em> 100 and 101. That
is, all the dead that remain after the redemption of those prepared,
are those who are under condemnation, and they will not come forth
through the resurrection until after the Millennium of a thousand
years, and not until after the "little season" in which Satan will be
loosed; or the end of the earth. It is mournful to think, that, even
after so long a period of probation, or trial, there will be then of
these spirits those who will still have to remain in the prison house,
for <em>verse</em> 102 says, "There are found among those who are to remain,
until that great and last day, even the end, who shall remain filthy
still."
</p>
<p>In another revelation we are informed, that a part of those who inherit
a terrestrial glory, will be "The spirits of men kept in prison, whom
the Son visited, and preached the Gospel unto them, that they might be
judged according to men in the flesh, Who received not the testimony of
Jesus in the flesh, but afterwards received it;" <em>sec</em>. 76. 73, 74.

<a name="Presidency"></a><h2>THE FIRST PRESIDENCY AND TWELVE APOSTLES.
</h2>
<h3>THE FIRST PRESIDENCY.</h3>

<p>It is revealed unto us in <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>., 20. 2, 3, that Joseph Smith,
Jun., was called of God and ordained an Apostle of the Lord Jesus
Christ to be the first Elder of this church; and that Oliver Cowdery
was also called of God, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, to be the second
Elder of this church. In <em>sec</em>. 18. we are informed that Oliver Cowdery
and David Whitmer were called with that same calling with which the
apostle Paul was called; but of Joseph Smith. Jun., the Lord said, 8th
<em>verse</em>, "Marvel not that I have called him unto mine own purpose,
which purpose is known in me." In <em>sec</em>. 27. 12, the Savior says: "And
also with Peter, and James, and John, whom I have sent unto you, by
whom I have ordained you and confirmed you to be Apostles, and especial
witnesses of my name, and bear the keys of your ministry, and of the
same things which I revealed unto them."
</p>
<p>Joseph, the first Apostle, continued as directed of the Lord from
time to time to organize and develop the offices and ordinances of
the church, for the saints were informed, in <em>sec</em>. 43. 3, "Ye shall
know assuredly that there is none other appointed unto you to receive
commandments and revelations until he be taken, if he abide in me."
</p>
<p>In <em>sec</em>. 107, on Priesthood, instructions are given how to organize
various councils and presidencies, in which is, <em>verse</em> 22, "Of
the Melchisedek Priesthood, three presiding High Priests, chosen
by the body, appointed and ordained to that office, and upheld by
the confidence, faith and prayer of the church." <em>Verse</em> 9, "The
Presidency of the High Priesthood, after the order of Melchisedek,
have a right to officiate in all the offices in the church;" and, as
in <em>verses</em> 18, 19, to hold the keys of all the spiritual blessings of
the church"&mdash;to have the privilege of receiving the mysteries of the
kingdom of heaven&mdash;to have the heavens opened unto them, to commune
with the general assembly and church of the firstborn, and to enjoy the
communion and presence of God the Father, and Jesus the Mediator of the
new covenant.
</p>
<p>In <em>verses</em> 91-2, "The duty of the President of the office of the High
Priesthood is to preside over the whole church, and to be like unto
Moses. Yea, to be a Seer, a revelator, a translator and a prophet,
having all the gifts of God which he bestows upon the head of the
church." In this light and sense does the church uphold, by their vote,
their faith and their prayers, the First Presidency of the church, or
the Presiding High Priest over the High Priesthood of the church.
</p>
<a name="Twelve"></a><h3>THE TWELVE APOSTLES.
</h3>
<p>The Twelve Apostles, or the twelve traveling counselors, are called to
be the Twelve Apostles, or special witnesses of the name of Christ in
all the world; and they form a quorum, equal in authority and power to
the three Presidents previously mentioned&mdash;the decisions of each being
unanimous. <em>Doc. &amp; Cov., sec</em>. 107, <em>verses</em> 23, 24. In <em>verse</em> 33
they "are to officiate in the name of the Lord, under the direction of
the Presidency of the church, agreeable to the institution of heaven:
to build up the church and regulate the affairs of the same in all
nations; first unto the Gentiles, and secondly unto the Jews."
</p>
<p>The foregoing laconic description of their duties is so comprehensive
that we will not detail further than to refer the student to <em>verses</em>
23, 24, 35, 38, 39, 58 for further description of the duties of the
Twelve Apostles.
</p>
<p>In <em>sec</em>. 112, <em>verses</em> 30-32, the Lord says to them: "For unto you,
(the Twelve,) and those (the First Presidency) who are appointed with
you to be your counselors and your leaders, is the power of this
Priesthood given, for the last days and for the last time, in the which
is the dispensation of the fulness of times, which power you hold in
connection with all those who have received a dispensation at any time
from the beginning of the creation."
</p>
<p>At the dedication of the Temple in Kirtland, the Prophet Joseph "called
upon the quorums and the congregation of Saints to acknowledge the
Twelve Apostles, who were present, as Prophets, Seers and Revelators,
and special witnesses to all the nations of the earth, holding the
keys of the kingdom, to unlock it, or cause it to be done, among them,
and uphold them with their prayers, which they assented to by rising:"
<em>His. of Joseph Smith, March</em> 27, 1836.
</p>
<p>The following is a list of the names, time of birth and date of
membership of the First Presidency and of the Twelve Apostles of this
Dispensation, given in the order in which they were set apart to those
offices, so far as we have ascertained:
</p>
<p>Lyman E. Johnson was born October 24, 1811, at Pomfret, Windsor County,
Vermont; was ordained an apostle at the organization of the first
Council of Apostles, at Kirtland, February 14, 1835, and was cut off
from the Council and the church April 13, 1838, at Far West, Missouri.
</p>
<p>Brigham Young was born June 1, 1801, at Whittingham, Windsor County,
Vermont; was ordained an apostle February 14, 1835, at Kirtland. From
the apostacy of Thomas B. Marsh in October, 1838, he was President
of the Twelve, and from December 27, 1847, was sustained as First
President of the church, with Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards as
his counselors. This position he occupied until his death, on the 29th
of August, 1877.
</p>
<p>Heber C. Kimball was born June 14, 1801, at Sheldon, Franklin County,
Vermont; was ordained an apostle February 14, 1835, at Kirtland, and
was first counselor to President Brigham Young, from December 27, 1847,
until his death, on the 22d of June 1868.
</p>
<p>Orson Hyde was born January 8, 1805, at Oxford, New Haven County,
Connecticut; was ordained an apostle February 15, 1835, at Kirtland,
and died at Spring City, Utah, November 28, 1878.
</p>
<p>David W. Patten was born in the State of New York, about A. D. 1800;
was ordained an apostle February 15, 1835, at Kirtland. He was fatally
shot, by a mob, at Crooked River, Missouri, on the 25th of October,
1838, and died the same day, firm in the faith.
</p>
<p>Luke S. Johnson was born November 3, 1807, at Pomfret, Windsor County,
Vermont; was ordained an apostle February 15, 1835, at Kirtland. He was
disfellowshipped September 3, 1837, at Kirtland, and was cut off at Far
West, April 13, 1838.

<a name="Consecration"></a><h2>CONSECRATION&mdash;STEWARDSHIP&mdash;UNITED ORDER.
</h2>
<p>To the Elder or Saint who has studied the revelations of our Lord Jesus
Christ, as given in the Doctrine and Covenants, by the light of the
Holy Spirit, it is most abundantly manifest that the human family has
departed, degenerated or apostatized from original methods in their
secular or business concerns, as truly, and as extensively, as they
have in their spiritual interests, or the matters of their religious
faith.
</p>
<p>Enoch instituted an order of things among his people, in their business
and financial relations, which so revolutionized their temporalities,
that they had no poor among them, and all rejoiced together in equal
hope of the life and exaltation, offered to them in the Gospel of Jesus
Christ, the Only Begotten of the Father.
</p>
<p>This very peculiar condition of things has been revealed to us under
the style of United Order of Enoch, and it would surprise many who have
given little attention to it to know how much is said in explanation
and support of this doctrine in the Revelations.
</p>
<p>We have thought that our little work could not be considered complete
without a studied article, explanatory of this subject, but have
concluded to give some references and citations, and invite the
earnest students and scholars in the Church to investigate these great
principles of social reform which have long puzzled the scientists and
moralists of our age, which are worthy the efforts of our best minds,
enlightened by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, and which God has
promised to set in order in his Church, in his own time and in his own
way.

<a name="gems"></a><h2>GEMS FROM THE HISTORY OF JOSEPH SMITH.
</h2>
<p><em>May</em>, 25, 1835, in a Council of the Twelve, Brigham Young, one of the
Twelve, Elders John P. Greene and Amos Orton were set apart to open the
door of the Gospel to the remnants of Joseph.
</p>
<p>PRESIDENCY OF THE TWELVE.&mdash;<em>January</em> 16, 1836, in a Council of the
Twelve the Prophet Joseph made the following remark: "The Twelve are
not subject to any other than the First Presidency, viz.: myself,
Sidney Rigdon, and Frederick G. Williams, who are now my Counselors;
(and where I am not, there is no First Presidency over the Twelve.)"
</p>
<p>A Vision.&mdash;<em>January</em> 21, 1836, the Prophet Joseph says of this time;
"The heavens were opened upon us, and I beheld the celestial kingdom of
God, and the glory thereof, whether in the body or out I cannot tell.
I saw the transcendent beauty of the gate through which the heirs of
that kingdom will enter, which was like unto circling flames of fire;
also the blazing throne of God, whereon was seated the Father and
the Son. I saw the beautiful streets of that kingdom, which had the
appearance of being paved with gold. I saw Fathers Adam and Abraham,
and my father and mother, my brother Alvin, that has long since slept,
and marvelled how it was that he had obtained an inheritance in that
kingdom, seeing that he had departed this life before the Lord had set
his hand to gather Israel the second time, and had not been baptized
for the remission of sins. Thus came the voice of the Lord unto me,
saying&mdash;All who have died without a knowledge of this Gospel, who would
have received it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs
of the celestial kingdom of God; also all that shall die henceforth
without a knowledge of it, who would have received it with all their
hearts, shall be heirs of that kingdom, for I, the Lord, will judge all
men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts.
And I also beheld all children who die before they arrive at years of
accountability, are saved in the celestial kingdom of heaven. * * *
</p>
<p>"Many of my brethren who received the ordinance with me saw glorious
visions also. Angels ministered unto them as well as myself, and the
power of the Highest rested upon us, the house was filled with the
glory of God, and we shouted Hosanna to God and the Lamb."
</p>
<p>THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY.&mdash;<em>On the evening of March</em> 27, 1836, President
Joseph Smith met the Quorums of the Priesthood in the Temple, and
instructed them respecting the ordinance of washing of feet, and in
relation to the Spirit of prophecy, "And called upon the congregation
to speak, and not to fear to prophesy good concerning the Saints,
for if you prophesy the falling of these hills, and the rising of
the valleys, the downfall of the enemies of Zion, and the rising of
the kingdom of God, it shall come to pass. Do not quench the Spirit,
for the first one that opens his mouth shall receive the spirit of
prophecy. Brother G. A. Smith arose, and began to prophesy, when a
noise was heard like the sound of a rushing mighty wind, which filled
the Temple, and all the congregation simultaneously arose, being
moved upon by an invisible power; many began to speak in tongues, and
prophesy; others saw glorious visions; and I beheld the Temple was
filled with angels, which fact I declared to the congregation. The
people of the neighborhood came running together, (hearing an unusual
sound within, and seeing a bright light like a pillar of fire resting
upon the Temple,) and were astonished at what was transpiring."
</p>
<p>WHAT THE ELDERS SHOULD PREACH.&mdash;<em>March</em> 30, 1836, the Elders met in the
Kirtland Temple, to attend to the ordinance of washing of feet, under
the direction of the Prophet Joseph. He made the following remarks:
</p>
<p>"That the time that we were required to tarry in Kirtland to be endued,
would be fulfilled in a few days, and then the Elders would go forth,
and each must stand for himself, as it was not necessary for them to be
sent out, two by two, as in former times, but to go in all meekness,
in sobriety, and preach Jesus Christ and him crucified; not to contend
with others on account of their faith, or systems of religion, but
pursue a steady course. This I delivered by way of commandment; and
all who observe it not, will pull down persecution upon their heads,
while those who do, shall always be filled with the Holy Ghost; this I
pronounced as a prophecy, and sealed with hosanna and Amen."
</p>
<p>THE COMFORTER.&mdash;From instructions of the Prophet Joseph, given at a
Conference of the Twelve, <em>June</em> 27, 1839.
</p>
<p>"There are two Comforters spoken of. One is the Holy Ghost, the same as
given on the day of Pentecost, and that all Saints receive after faith,
repentance, and baptism. This first Comforter or Holy Ghost has no
other effect than pure intelligence. It is more powerful in expanding
the mind, enlightening the understanding, and storing the intellect
with present knowledge, of a man who is of the literal seed of Abraham,
than one that is a Gentile, though it may not have half as much visible
effect upon the body; for as the Holy Ghost falls upon one of the
literal seed of Abraham, it is calm and serene; and his whole soul and
body are only exercised by the pure spirit of intelligence; while the
effect of the Holy Ghost upon a Gentile, is to purge out the old blood,
and make him actually of the seed of Abraham.
</p>
<p>That man that has none of the blood of Abraham (naturally) must have a
new creation by the Holy Ghost. In such a case, there may be more of
a powerful effect upon the body, and visible to the eye, than upon an
Israelite, while the Israelite at first might be far before the Gentile
in pure intelligence.
</p>
<p>THE OTHER COMFORTER spoken of is a subject of great interest, and
perhaps understood by few of this generation. After a person hath faith
in Christ, repents of his sins, and is baptized for the remission of
his sins and receives the Holy Ghost, (by the laying on of hands,)
which is the first Comforter, then let him continue to humble himself
before God, hungering and thirsting after righteousness, and living
by every word of God, and the Lord will soon say unto him, Son, thou
shalt be exalted, etc. When the Lord has thoroughly proved him, and
finds that the man is determined to serve him at all hazards, then the
man will find his calling and his election made sure, then it will be
his privilege to receive the <em>other Comforter</em>, which the Lord hath
promised the Saints, as is recorded in the testimony of St. John, in
the 14th chapter, from the 12th to the 27th verses. * *
</p>
<p>Now, what is this <em>other Comforter</em>? It is no more or less than the
LORD JESUS CHRIST himself; and this is the sum and substance of the
whole matter; that when any man obtains this last Comforter, he will
have the personage of Jesus Christ to attend him, or appear unto him
from time to time, and even he will manifest the Father unto him, and
they will take up their abode with him, and the visions of the heavens
will be opened unto him, and the Lord will teach him face to face, and
he may have a perfect knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of God;
and this is the state and place the ancient Saints arrived at when
they had such glorious visions&mdash;Isaiah, Ezekiel, John upon the Isle
of Patmos, St. Paul in the three heavens, and all the Saints who held
communion with the general assembly and <em>Church of the First Born</em>, etc.
</p>
<p>"THE SPIRIT OF REVELATION is in connection with these blessings. A
person may profit by noticing the first intimations of the Spirit of
Revelation; for instance, when you feel pure intelligence flowing unto
you, it may give you sudden strokes of ideas, that by noticing it,
you may find it fulfilled the same day or soon; (i. e.,) those things
that were presented unto your mind by the Spirit of God, will come to
pass; and thus by learning the Spirit of God and understanding it, you
may grow into the principle of Revelation, until you become perfect in
Christ Jesus."
</p>
<p>FORGIVE ONE ANOTHER.&mdash;"Ever keep in exercise the principle of mercy,
and be ready to forgive our brother on the first intimations of
repentance, and asking forgiveness; and should we even forgive our
brother, or even our enemy, before they repent or ask forgiveness, our
Heavenly Father would be equally as merciful unto us."
</p>
<p>KEYS.&mdash;<em>July</em> 2, 1839, at a meeting of the Twelve and some of the
Seventies, President Joseph Smith made the following remarks: "O ye
Twelve! and all Saints! profit by this important KEY&mdash;that in all your
trials, troubles, temptations, afflictions, bonds, imprisonments and
death, see to it, that you do not betray heaven; that you do not betray
<em>Jesus Christ</em>; that you do not betray the <em>brethren</em>; that you do not
betray the <em>revelations</em> of God, whether in the Bible, Book of Mormon,
or Doctrine and Covenants, or any other that ever was or ever will be
given and revealed unto man in this world or that which is to come.
Yea, in all your kicking and flounderings, see to it that you do not
this thing, lest innocent blood be found in your skirts, and you go
down to hell. All other sins are not to be compared to sinning against
the Holy Ghost, and proving a traitor to thy brethren.
</p>
<p>I will give unto you one of the <em>keys</em> of the mysteries of the
kingdom. It is an eternal principle, that has existed with God from
all eternity: That man who rises up to condemn others, finding fault
with the Church, saying that they are out of the way, while he himself
is righteous, then know assuredly, that that man is in the highroad to
apostacy; and if he does not repent, will apostatize, as God lives.
</p>
<p>The principle is as correct as the one Jesus put forth in saying, that
he who seeketh a sign is an adulterous person; and that principle is
eternal, undeviating, and firm as the pillars of heaven; for whenever
you see a man seeking after a sign, you may set it down that he is an
adulterous man.
</p>
<p>COMING OF THE SON OF MAN.&mdash;On another occasion about this time the
prophet Joseph made the following remarks: "Men profess to prophesy.
I will prophesy that the signs of the coming of the Son of Man are
already commenced. One pestilence will desolate after another. We shall
soon have war and bloodshed. The moon will be turned into blood. I
testify of these things, and that the coming of the Son of Man is nigh,
even at your doors. If our souls and our bodies are not looking forth
for the coming of the Son of Man; and after we are dead, if we are not
looking forth, &amp;c.; we shall be among those who are calling for the
rocks to fall upon us, &amp;c. * * * The time is soon coming when no man
will have any peace but in Zion and her Stakes.
</p>
<p>"I saw men hunting the lives of their own sons, and brother murdering
brother, women killing their own daughters, and daughters seeking the
lives of their mothers. I saw armies arrayed against armies. I saw
blood, desolation, fires. &amp;c.
</p>
<p>"The Son of Man has said that the mother shall be against the daughter,
and the daughter against the mother, &amp;c. These things are at our doors.
They will follow the Saints of God from city to city. Satan will rage,
and the spirit of the devil is now enraged. I know not how soon these
things will take place; and with a view of them, shall I cry peace? No!
I will lift up my voice and testify of them. How long you will have
good crops, and the famine be kept off, I do not know; when the fig
tree leaves, know then that the summer is nigh at hand."
</p>
<p>THE SAINTS MUST SUFFER.&mdash;<em>September</em> 29, 1839, "Explained concerning
the coming of the Son of Man, &amp;c.; also that it is a false idea that
the Saints will escape all the judgments, whilst the wicked suffer;
for all flesh is subject to suffer, and 'the righteous shall hardly
escape;' still many of the Saints will escape, for the just shall live
by faith; yet many of the righteous shall fall a prey to disease, to
pestilence, etc., by reason of the weakness of the flesh, and yet be
saved in the kingdom of God. So that it is an unhallowed principle to
say that such and such have transgressed because they have been preyed
upon by disease or death, for all flesh is subject to death; and the
Savior said, 'Judge not, lest ye be judged.'"
</p>
<p>TRANSLATION.&mdash;<em>October</em> 5, 1840. "Many may have supposed that the
doctrine of translation was a doctrine whereby men were taken
immediately into the presence of God, and into an eternal fulness,
but this is a mistaken idea. Their place of habitation is that of the
terrestrial order, and a place prepared for such characters, be held in
reserve to be ministering angels unto many planets, and who as yet have
not entered into so great a fulness as those who are resurrected from
the dead. * * * This distinction is made between the doctrine of the
actual resurrection and translation: translation obtains deliverance
from the tortures and sufferings of the body, but their existence will
prolong as to the labors and toils of the ministry, before they can
enter into so great a rest and glory."
</p>
<p>SACRIFICE TO BE RESTORED.&mdash;"It is generally supposed that sacrifice was
entirely done away when the Great Sacrifice was offered up, and that
there will be no necessity for the ordinance of sacrifice in future;
but those who assert this are certainly not acquainted with the duties,
privileges, and authority of the Priesthood, or with the Prophets. * *
</p>
<p>"These sacrifices, as well as every ordinance belonging to the
Priesthood, will, when the Temple of the Lord shall be built, and the
sons of Levi be purified, be fully restored and attended to in all
their powers, ramifications, and blessings. This ever did and will
exist when the powers of the Melchizedec Priesthood are sufficiently
manifest; else how can the restitution of all things spoken of by all
the holy Prophets be brought to pass?"
</p>
<p>BOOK OF MORMON.&mdash;<em>November</em> 28, 1841. In council with the Twelve
Apostles, Joseph Smith said, "I told the brethren that the Book of
Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone
of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its
precepts, than by any other book."
</p>
<p>THE RESURRECTION.&mdash;<em>March</em> 20, 1842. From a sermon of Joseph Smith's:
"As concerning the resurrection, I will merely say that all men will
come from the grave as they lie down, whether old or young; there will
not be 'added unto their stature one cubit,' neither taken from it; all
will be raised by the power of God, having spirit in their bodies, and
not blood."
</p>
<p>SPIRIT AND MATTER.&mdash;<em>April</em> 1, 1842. The Prophet Joseph said, "In
tracing the thing to the foundation, and looking at it philosophically,
we shall find a very material difference between the body and the
spirit: the body is supposed to be organized matter, and the spirit,
by many, is thought to be immaterial, without substance. With this
latter statement we should beg leave to differ, and state that spirit
is a substance; that it is material, but that it is more pure, elastic,
and refined matter than the body; that it existed before the body, can
exist in the body, and will exist separate from the body, when the body
will be mouldering in the dust; and will in the resurrection, be again
united with it."
</p>
<p>MUST BE LIKE GOD.&mdash;<em>April</em> 10, 1842. Joseph Smith said, "If you wish to
go where God is, you must be like God, or possess the principles which
God possesses, for if we are not drawing towards God in principle, we
are going from Him and drawing towards the devil. * * * A man is saved
no faster than he gets knowledge, for if he does not get knowledge, he
will be brought into captivity by some evil power in the other world,
as evil spirits will have more knowledge, and consequently more power
than many men who are on the earth. Hence it needs revelation to assist
us, and give us knowledge of the things of God.".
</p>
<p>KEYS.&mdash;<em>May</em> 1, 1842. "The KEYS are certain signs and words by which
false spirits and personages may be detected from true, which cannot be
revealed to the Elders till the Temple is completed. The rich can only
get them in the Temple, the poor may get them on the mountain top as
Moses did."
</p>
<p>CHARITY.&mdash;"The rich cannot be saved without charity, giving to feed the
poor when and how God requires."
</p>
<p>SIGNS.&mdash;"There are signs in heaven, earth, and hell; the Elders must
know them all, to be endowed with power, to finish their work and
prevent imposition. The devil knows many signs, but does not know the
sign of the Son of Man, or Jesus. No one can truly say he knows God
until he has handled something, and this can only be in the Holiest of
Holies."
</p>
<p>A PROPHECY.&mdash;<em>August</em> 6, 1842. "I prophesied that the Saints would
continue to suffer much affliction and would be driven to the Rocky
Mountains, many would apostatize, others would be put to death by our
persecutors, or lose their lives in consequence of exposure or disease,
and some of you will live to go and assist in making settlements and
build cities and see the Saints become a mighty people in the midst of
the Rocky Mountains."
</p>
<p>THE MILLENNIUM.&mdash;<em>December</em> 30, 1842. "Christ and the resurrected
Saints will reign over the earth during the thousand years. They will
not probably dwell on the earth, but will visit it when they please,
or when it is necessary to govern it. There will be wicked men on the
earth during the thousand years. The heathen nations who will not come
up to worship will be visited with the judgments of God, and must
eventually be destroyed from the earth."
</p>
<p>SIGN OF A DOVE.&mdash;<em>January</em> 29, 1843. "The sign of the dove was
instituted before the creation of the world, a witness for the Holy
Ghost, and the Devil cannot come in the sign of a dove."
</p>
<p>COMING OF THE SON OF MAN.&mdash;<em>April</em> 6, 1843. "Judah must return,
Jerusalem must be rebuilt, and the Temple, and water come out from
under the Temple, and the waters of the Dead Sea be healed. It will
take some time to build the walls of the city and the Temple, &amp;c.; and
all this must be done before the Son of Man will make his appearance.
There will be wars and rumors of wars, signs in the heavens above and
on the earth beneath, the sun turned into darkness and the moon to
blood, earthquakes in divers places, the seas heaving beyond their
bounds; then will appear one grand sign of the Son of Man in heaven.
But what will the world do? They will say it is a planet, a comet, &amp;c.
But the Son of Man will come as the sign of the coming of the Son of
Man, which will be as the light of the morning cometh out of the east."
</p>
<p>SOME SEEK TO EXCEL.&mdash;<em>May</em> 14, 1843. "In this world, mankind are
naturally selfish, ambitious, and striving to excel above one another.
* * So in the other world there is a variety of spirits. Some seek to
excel. And this was the case with Lucifer when he fell. He sought for
things which were unlawful. Hence he was cast down, and it is said he
drew away many with him; and the greatness of his punishment is, that
he shall not have a tabernacle. This is his punishment."
</p>
<p>THE MORE SURE WORD OF PROPHECY.&mdash;"Now for the secret and grand key.
Though they might hear the voice of God and know that Jesus was the Son
of God, this would be no evidence that their election and calling was
made sure, that they had part with Christ, and were joint heirs with
him. They then would want that more sure word of prophecy, that they
were sealed in the heavens and had the promise of eternal life in the
kingdom of God. Then, having this promise sealed unto them, it was an
anchor to the soul, sure and steadfast."
</p>
<p>HID WITH CHRIST IN GOD.&mdash;<em>May</em> 16, 1843. "Your life is hid with Christ
in God, and so are many others. Nothing but the unpardonable sin can
prevent you from inheriting eternal glory, for you are sealed up by
the power of the Priesthood unto eternal life, having taken the step
necessary for the purpose. * * * The unpardonable sin is to shed
innocent blood, or be accessory thereto. All other sins will be visited
with judgment in the flesh, and the spirit being delivered to the
buffetings of Satan until the day of the Lord Jesus."
</p>
<p>THREE DEGREES IN CELESTIAL GLORY.&mdash;"In the celestial glory there are
three heavens or degrees; and in order to obtain the highest, a man
must enter into this order of the Priesthood; and if he does not, he
cannot obtain it. He may enter into the other, but that is the end of
his kingdom: he cannot have an increase."
</p>
<p>SALVATION.&mdash;<em>May</em> 17, 1843. "Salvation means a man's being placed
beyond the power of all his enemies. The more sure word of prophecy
means a man's knowing that he is sealed up unto eternal life by
revelation and the spirit of prophecy, through the power of the holy
Priesthood. It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance."
</p>
<p>ETERNAL DURATION OF MATTER.&mdash;"Speaking of the eternal duration of
matter, I said.&mdash;There is no such thing as immaterial matter. All
spirit is matter, but is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned
by purer eyes. We cannot see it; but when our bodies are purified, we
shall see that it is all matter."
</p>
<p>THE PUNISHMENT OF THE DEVIL.&mdash;<em>May</em> 21, 1843. "The spirits in the
eternal world are like the spirits in this world. When those spirits
have come into this world and received tabernacles, then died, and
again have risen and received glorified bodies, they will have an
ascendancy over the spirits who have no bodies, or kept not their first
estate, like the Devil. The punishment of the Devil was, that he should
not have a habitation like men. The Devil's retaliation is, he comes
into this world, binds up men's bodies, and occupies them himself. When
the authorities come along, they eject him from a stolen habitation."
</p>
<p>THE THREE KEYS.&mdash;"We have no claim in our eternal compact, in relation
to eternal things, unless our actions and contracts and all things tend
to this end. But after all this, you have got to make your calling and
election sure.
</p>
<p>"If this injunction would lie largely on those to whom it was spoken,
how much more those of the present generation. First key: Knowledge
is the power of salvation. Second key: Make your calling and election
sure. Third key: It is one thing to be on the mount and hear the
excellent voice, &amp;c., &amp;c.; and another to hear the voice declare to
you, you have a part and lot in that kingdom."
</p>
<p>JOHN THE BAPTIST.&mdash;<em>May</em> 24, 1843. "After naming his text, the Prophet
remarked that some one had asked him the meaning of the expression of
Jesus&mdash;'Among those born of women, there has not arisen a greater than
John;' and said he had promised to answer it in public and he would do
it then.
</p>
<p>"It could not have been on account of the miracles John performed, for
he did no miracles; but it was&mdash;First, because he was trusted with a
divine mission of preparing the way before the face of the Lord. Who
was trusted with such a mission before or since? No man. Second, he
was trusted and it was required at his hand to baptize the Son of Man.
Whoever did that? Who ever had so great a privilege or glory? Who ever
led the Son of God into the waters of baptism, beholding the <em>Holy
Ghost</em> descend upon him in the sign of a dove? <em>No man</em>.
</p>
<p>"Third, John at that time was the only legal administrator holding the
keys of power there was on earth. The keys, the kingdom, the power,
the glory had departed from the Jews; and John, the son of Zachariah,
by the anointing and decree of heaven, held the keys of power at that
time."
</p>
<p>THE PRINCIPLE THAT CRUCIFIED JESUS CHRIST.&mdash;<em>June</em> 11, 1843. "Many
men will say, 'I will never forsake you, but will stand by you at all
times.' But the moment you teach them some of the mysteries of the
kingdom of God that are retained in the heavens and are to be revealed
to the children of men when they are prepared for them, they will be
the first to stone you and put you to death. It was this same principle
that crucified the Lord Jesus Christ, and will cause the people to kill
the Prophets in this generation."
</p>
<p>A FULNESS OF ORDINANCES NECESSARY.&mdash;"All men who become heirs of God
and joint heirs of Jesus Christ will have to receive the fulness of
the ordinances of his kingdom; and those who will not receive all the
ordinances will come short of the fulness of that glory, if they do not
lose the whole."
</p>
<p>THE WORLD OF SPIRITS.&mdash;"Hades, the Greek, or Shaole, the Hebrew: these
two significations mean a world of spirits. Hades, Shaole, paradise,
spirits in prison, are all one: it is a world of spirits.
</p>
<p>"The righteous and the wicked all go to the same world of spirits until
the resurrection. * * The great misery of departed spirits in the
world of spirits, where they go after death, is to know that they come
short of the glory that others enjoy and that they might have enjoyed
themselves, and they are their own accusers."
</p>
<p>THREE PERSONS IN HEAVEN HOLDING THE KEYS OF POWER.&mdash;"Any person that
has seen the heavens opened knows that there are three personages in
the heavens who hold the keys of power, and one presides over all.
* * * As the Father hath power in himself, so hath the Son power in
himself, to lay down his life and take it again, so he has a body of
his own. The Son doeth what he hath seen the Father do: then the Father
hath some day laid down his life and taken it again; so he has a body
of his own; each one will be in his own body."
</p>
<p>FORGIVE ALL MEN.&mdash;<em>July</em> 9, 1843. "Joseph remarked that all was well
between him and the heavens; that he had no enmity against anyone; and
as the prayer of Jesus, or his pattern, so prayed Joseph&mdash;'Father,
forgive me my trespasses as I forgive those who trespass against me,'
for I freely forgive all men. If we would secure and cultivate the love
of others, we must love others, even our enemies as well as friends."
</p>
<p>NECESSITY OF BAPTISM.&mdash;The Gospel requires baptism by immersion for the
remission of sins, which is the meaning of the word in the original
language&mdash;namely, to bury or immerse. * * But I further believe in the
gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands. * * Might as well
baptize a bag of sand as a man, if not done in view of the remission
of sins and getting of the Holy Ghost. Baptism by water is but half a
baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half&mdash;that is, the
baptism of the Holy Ghost.
</p>
<p>SEALING OF THE SERVANTS OF GOD.&mdash;<em>August</em> 13, 1843. "Four destroying
angels holding power over the four quarters of the earth until the
servants of God are sealed in their foreheads, which signifies sealing
the blessing upon their heads, meaning the everlasting covenant,
thereby making their calling and election sure. When a seal is put upon
the father and mother, it secures their posterity, so that they cannot
be lost, but will be saved by virtue of the covenant of their father
and mother."
</p>
<p>THE KING OF SALEM.&mdash;<em>August</em> 18, 1843. "The King of Shiloam (Salem) had
power and authority over that of Abraham, holding the key and the power
of endless life."
</p>
<p>"THE SACRIFICE REQUIRED OF ABRAHAM in the offering up of Isaac shows
that if a man would attain to the keys of the kingdom of an endless
life, he must sacrifice all things. When God offers a blessing or
knowledge to a man, and he refuses to receive it, he will be damned."
</p>
<p>THE FULNESS OF THE MELCHISEDEK PRIESTHOOD.&mdash;"Those holding the fulness
of the Melchisedek Priesthood are kings and priests of the Most High
God, holding the keys of power and blessings! In fact, that Priesthood
is a perfect law of theocracy, and stands as God to give laws to the
people, administering endless lives to the sons and daughters of Adam.
</p>
<p>"Abram says to Melchisedek, I believe all that thou hast taught
me concerning the Priesthood and the coming of the Son of Man; so
Melchisedek ordained Abram, and sent him away. Abram rejoiced, saying,
Now I have a Priesthood. * * Elijah shall reveal the covenants to seal
the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the
fathers. The anointing and sealing is to be called, elected, and made
sure."
</p>
<p>SPIRITS OF THE JUST.&mdash;<em>October</em> 9, 1843. "Spirits can only be revealed
in flaming fire or glory. Angels have advanced further, their light
and glory being tabernacled; and hence they appear in bodily shape.
The spirits of just men are made ministering servants to those who are
sealed unto life eternal, and it is through them that the sealing power
comes down. * *
</p>
<p>"The spirits of the just are exalted to a greater and more glorious
work; hence they are blessed in their departure to the world of
spirits. Enveloped in flaming fire, they are not far from us, and know
and understand our thoughts, feelings, and notions, and are often
pained therewith.
</p>
<p>"Flesh and blood cannot go there; but flesh and bones, quickened by the
Spirit of God, can."
</p>
<p>THE KINGDOM OF GOD.&mdash;<em>October</em> 15, 1843. "It is one thing to see the
Kingdom of God, and another thing to enter into it. We must have a
change of heart to see the Kingdom of God, and subscribe the articles
of adoption to enter therein.
</p>
<p>ADULTERY.&mdash;<em>November</em> 25, 1843. "If a man commit adultery, he cannot
receive the celestial kingdom of God. Even if he is saved in any
kingdom, it cannot be the celestial kingdom."
</p>
<p>SAVIORS ON MOUNT ZION.&mdash;<em>January</em> 20, 1844. "The Bible says, 'I will
send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful
day of the Lord; and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the
children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers, lest I come
and smite the earth with a curse.'
</p>
<p>"Now, the word <em>turn</em> here should be translated <em>bind</em>, or seal. But
what is the object of this important mission? or how is it to be
fulfilled? The keys are to be delivered, the spirit of Elijah is to
come, the Gospel to be established, the Saints of God gathered, Zion
built up, and the Saints to come up as Saviors on Mount Zion.
</p>
<p>"But how are they to become Saviors on Mount Zion? By building their
temples, erecting their baptismal fonts, and going forth and receiving
all the ordinances, baptisms, confirmations, washings, anointings,
ordinations, and sealing powers upon their heads, in behalf of all
their progenitors who are dead, and redeem them that they may come
forth in the first resurrection and be exalted to thrones of glory with
them; and herein is the chain that binds the hearts of the fathers
to the children, and the children to the fathers, which fulfils the
mission of Elijah. * *
</p>
<p>"The Saints have not too much time to save and redeem their dead, and
gather together their living relatives, that they may be saved also,
before the earth will be smitten, and the consumption decreed falls
upon the world."
</p>
<p>THE SPIRIT OF ELIAS.&mdash;<em>March</em> 10, 1844. "The spirit of Elias is
to prepare the way for a greater revelation of God, which is the
Priesthood of Elias, or the Priesthood that Aaron was ordained unto.
And when God sends a man into the world to prepare for a greater work,
holding the keys of the power of Elias, it was called the doctrine of
Elias, even from the early ages of the world. * * * This is the Elias
spoken of in the last days, and here is the rock upon which many split,
thinking the time was past in the days of John and Christ, and no more
to be. But the spirit of Elias was revealed to me, and I know it is
true; therefore I speak with boldness, for I know verily my doctrine is
true."
</p>
<p>THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH.&mdash;"Now for Elijah. The spirit, power, and calling
of Elijah is, that ye have power to hold the keys of the revelations,
ordinances, oracles, powers, and endowments of the fulness of the
Melchisedek Priesthood and of the kingdom of God on the earth; and
to receive, obtain, and perform all the ordinances belonging to the
kingdom of God, even unto the turning of the hearts of the fathers
unto the children, and the hearts of the children unto the fathers,
even those who are in heaven. * * Now comes the point. What is this
office and work of Elijah? It is one of the greatest and most important
subjects that God has revealed. He should send Elijah to seal the
children to the fathers, and the fathers to the children. * * I wish
you to understand this subject, for it is important; and if you will
receive it, this is the spirit of Elijah, that we redeem our dead, and
connect ourselves with our fathers which are in heaven, and seal up
our dead to come forth in the first resurrection; and here we want the
power of Elijah <em>to seal those who dwell on earth to those who dwell
in heaven</em>. This is the power of Elijah and the keys of the kingdom
of Jehovah. * * Then what you seal on earth, by the keys of Elijah,
is sealed in heaven; and this is the power of Elijah, and this is the
difference between the spirit and power of Elias and Elijah; for while
the spirit of Elias is a forerunner, the power of Elijah is sufficient
to make our calling and election sure. * * We cannot be perfect without
the fathers, etc. We must have revelations from them, and we can see
that the doctrine of REVELATION as far transcends the doctrine of NO
REVELATION as knowledge is above ignorance; for one truth revealed from
heaven is worth all the sectarian notions in existence.
</p>
<p>"This spirit of Elijah was manifest in the days of the apostles, in
delivering certain ones to the buffetings of Satan, that they might
be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. They were sealed by the spirit
of Elijah unto the damnation of hell until the day of the Lord, or
revelation of Jesus Christ. * *
</p>
<p>"According to the Scriptures, if men have received the good word of
God, and tasted of the powers of the world to come, if they shall
fall away, it is impossible to renew them again, seeing they have
crucified the Son of God afresh, and put him to open shame; so there
is a possibility of falling away: you could not be renewed again, and
the power of Elijah cannot seal against this sin, for this is a reserve
made in the seals and power of the Priesthood. * *
</p>
<p>"A murderer, for instance, one that sheds innocent blood, cannot have
forgiveness. David sought repentance at the hand of God carefully, with
tears, for the murder of Uriah; but he could only get it through hell:
he got a promise that his soul should not be left in hell. Although
David was a king, he never did obtain the spirit and power of Elijah
and the fulness of the Priesthood; and the Priesthood that he received,
and the throne and kingdom of David is to be taken from him and given
to another by the name of David in the last days, raised up out of his
lineage.
</p>
<p>"This is the case with murderers. They could not be baptized for the
remission of sins, for they had shed innocent blood."
</p>
<p>THE SPIRIT OF MESSIAH.&mdash;"The spirit of Elias is first, Elijah second,
and Messiah last. Elias is a forerunner to prepare the way, and the
spirit and power of Elijah is to come after, holding the keys of
power, building the Temple to the cap stone, placing the seals of
the Melchisedek Priesthood upon the house of Israel, and making all
things ready; then <em>Messiah</em> comes to his Temple, which is last of all.
Messiah is above the spirit and power of Elijah, for he made the world,
and was that spiritual rock unto Moses in the wilderness. Elijah was to
come and prepare the way and build up the kingdom before the coming of
the great day of the Lord, although the spirit of Elias might begin it."
</p>
<p>ETERNAL LIFE.&mdash;<em>April</em> 7, 1844. "Here, then, is eternal life&mdash;to know
the only wise and true God; and you have got to learn how to be Gods
yourselves, and to be kings and priests to God, the same as all Gods
have done before you,&mdash;namely, by going from one small degree to
another, and from a small capacity to a great one; from grace to grace,
from exaltation to exaltation, until you attain to the resurrection of
the dead, and are able to dwell in everlasting burnings, and to sit in
glory, as do those who sit enthroned in everlasting power."
</p>
<p>ALL REVELATIONS ARE SPIRITUAL.&mdash;"All things whatsoever God of his
infinite wisdom has seen fit and proper to reveal to us, while we are
dwelling in mortality, in regard to our mortal bodies, are revealed
to us in the abstract and independent of affinity of this mortal
tabernacle, but are revealed to our spirits precisely as though we had
no bodies at all; and those revelations which will save our spirits
will save our bodies. God reveals them to us in view of no eternal
dissolution of the body, or tabernacle. Hence the responsibility, the
awful responsibility, that rests upon us, in relation to our dead; for
all the spirits who have not obeyed the Gospel in the flesh must either
obey it in the spirit or be damned. * * * The greatest responsibility
in this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead.
The Apostle says, 'They without us cannot be made perfect;' for it is
necessary that the sealing power should be in our hands to seal our
children and our dead for the fulness of the dispensation of times&mdash;a
dispensation to meet the promises made by Jesus Christ before the
foundation of the world for the salvation of man."
</p>
<p>SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST.&mdash;"All sins, and all blasphemies, and every
transgression, except one, that man can be guilty of, may be forgiven;
and there is a salvation for all men, either in this world or the world
to come, who have not committed the unpardonable sin, there being a
provision either in this world or the world of spirits. Hence God hath
made a provision that every spirit in the eternal world can be ferreted
out and saved, unless he has committed that unpardonable sin which
cannot be remitted to him either in this world or the world of spirits.
God has wrought out a salvation for all men, unless they have committed
a certain sin; and every man who has a friend in the eternal world can
save him, unless he has committed the unpardonable sin. And so you can
see how you can be a savior."
</p>
<p>THE CONTENTION IN HEAVEN.&mdash;"The contention in heaven was&mdash;Jesus said
there would be certain souls that would not be saved; and the Devil
said he could save them all, and laid his plans before the grand
council, who gave their vote in favor of Jesus Christ. So the Devil
rose up in rebellion against God, and was cast down, with all who put
up their heads for him."
</p>
<p>FOREORDINATION OF MAN.&mdash;<em>May</em> 12, 1844. "Every man who has a calling
to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very
purpose in the Grand Council of heaven before this world was."
</p>
<p>GOD DWELLS IN ETERNAL FIRE.&mdash;"God Almighty himself dwells in eternal
fire: flesh and blood cannot go there, for all corruption is devoured
by the fire. Our God is a consuming fire. When our flesh is quickened
by the Spirit, there will be no blood in this tabernacle. Some dwell in
higher glory than others."
</p>
<p>THE RESURRECTION.&mdash;"All men who are immortal dwell in everlasting
burnings. You cannot go anywhere but where God can find you out. All
men are born to die, and all men must rise; all must enter eternity.
</p>
<p>"In order for you to receive your children to yourself, you must have
a promise&mdash;some ordinance, some blessing, in order to ascend above
principalities, or else it may be an angel. They must rise just as they
died: we can there hail our lovely infants with the same glory&mdash;the
same loveliness in the celestial glory, where they all enjoy alike.
They differ in stature, in size: the same glorious spirit gives them
the likeness of glory and bloom; the old man with his silvery hairs
will glory in bloom and beauty. No man can describe it to you&mdash;no man
can write it."
</p>
<p>COUNCIL OF HIGH PRIESTS.&mdash;<em>February</em> 12, 1834. The Prophet Joseph said:
"No man is capable of judging a matter, in Council, unless his own
heart is pure; and that we frequently are so filled with prejudice, or
have a beam in our own eye, that we are not capable of passing right
decisions, etc.
</p>
<p>"But to return to the subject of order: In ancient days, Councils were
conducted with strict propriety, that no one was allowed to whisper, be
weary, leave the room, or get uneasy in the least, until the voice of
the Lord, by revelation, or the voice of the Council by the Spirit was
obtained, which has not been observed in this Church to the present.
</p>
<p>"It was understood in ancient days, that if one man could stay in
Council, another could; and if the President could spend his time, the
members could also; but in our Councils, generally, one will be uneasy,
another asleep; one praying, another not; one's mind on the business of
the Council, and another thinking on something else, etc.
</p>
<p>"Our acts are rendered, and at a future day they will be laid before
us, and if we should fail to judge right and injure our fellow beings,
they may be there, perhaps, condemn us; there they are of great
consequence, and to me the consequence appears to be of force, beyond
anything which I am able to express, etc. Ask yourselves, brethren, how
much you have exercised yourselves in prayer since you heard of this
Council; and if you are now prepared to sit in Council upon the soul of
your brother."
</p>
<p>THE HIGH COUNCIL.&mdash;<em>July</em> 11, 1840. "The High Council met at my office,
when I taught them principles relating to their duty as a Council, and
that they might be guided by the same in future, I ordered it to be
recorded as follows: 'That the Council should try no case without both
parties being present, or having had an opportunity to be present,
neither should they hear one party's complaint before his case is
brought up for trial; neither should they suffer the character of any
one to be exposed before the High Council without the person being
present and ready to defend him or herself; that the minds of the
Councilors be not prejudiced for or against any one whose case they may
possibly have to act upon."
</p>
<p>BY THE PROPHET JOSEPH, <em>January</em> 5, 1841. "At the organization of a
school of instruction. Description of Paul: He is about five feet high;
very dark hair; dark complexion; dark skin; large Roman nose; sharp
face; small black eyes, penetrating as eternity; round shoulders; a
whining voice, except when elevated, and then it almost resembled the
roaring of a lion. He was a good orator, active and diligent, always
employing himself in doing good to his fellow man."
</p>
<p>DIFFERENT DEGREES OF THE PRIESTHOOD OF MELCHISEDEK.&mdash;"Answer to the
question, Was the Priesthood of Melchisedek taken away when Moses died?
All Priesthood is Melchisedek, but there are different portions or
degrees of it. That portion which brought Moses to speak with God face
to face was taken away; but that which brought the ministry of angels
remained. All the prophets had the Melchisedek Priesthood and were
ordained by God himself.
</p>
<p>The world and earth are not synonymous terms. The world is the human
family.&mdash;This earth was organized or formed out of other planets which
were broken up and remodeled and made into the one on which we live.
</p>
<p>The elements are eternal. That which has a beginning will surely have
an end; take a ring, it is without beginning or end&mdash;cut it for a
beginning place and at the same time you have an ending place.
</p>
<p>A key: Every principle proceeding from God is eternal and any principle
which is not eternal is of the devil. The sun has no beginning or end;
the rays which proceed from himself have no bounds, consequently are
eternal.
</p>
<p>So it is with God. If the soul of man had a beginning it will surely
have an end. In the translation 'without form and void' it should read,
empty and desolate. The word created should be formed, or organized.'"
</p>
<p>OBSERVATION ON THE SECTARIAN GOD.&mdash;"That which is without body, parts
and passions is nothing. There is no other God in heaven but that God
who has flesh and bones. <em>John</em>, 5. 26, As the Father hath life in
himself, even so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself. God
the Father took life unto himself precisely as Jesus did.
</p>
<p>"The first step in the salvation of man is the laws of eternal
and self-existent principles. Spirits are eternal. At the first
organization in heaven we were all present, and saw the Savior chosen
and appointed and the plan of salvation made, and we sanctioned it.
</p>
<p>We came to this earth that we might have a body and present it pure
before God in the celestial kingdom. The great principle of happiness
consists is having a body. The devil has no body, and herein is his
punishment. He is pleased when he can obtain the tabernacle of man,
and when cast out by the Savior he asked to go into the herd of swine,
showing that he would prefer a swine's body to having none.
</p>
<p>All beings who have bodies have power over those who have not. The
devil has no power over us only as we permit him. The moment we
revolt at anything which comes from God, the devil takes power. This
earth will be rolled back into the presence of God, and crowned with
celestial glory."
</p>
<p>THREE INDEPENDENT PRINCIPLES.&mdash;<em>May</em> 16, 1841. "There are three
independent principles; the Spirit of God, the spirit of man, and the
spirit of the devil. All men have power to resist the devil.
</p>
<p>"They who have tabernacles, have power over those who have not. The
doctrine of eternal judgment; <em>Acts</em> 2. 41. Peter preached, Repent, and
be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins,
&amp;c.; but in <em>Acts</em> 3. 19 he says, Repent and be converted, that your
sins may be blotted out when the times of redemption shall come, and he
shall send Jesus, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>"Remission of sins by baptism was not to be preached to murderers.
All the priests of Christendom might pray for a murderer on the
scaffold forever, but could not avail so much as a gnat towards their
forgiveness. There is no forgiveness for murderers; they will have to
wait until the times of redemption shall come, and that in hell. Peter
had the keys of eternal judgment, and he saw David in hell, and knew
for what reason, and that David would have to remain there until the
resurrection at the coming of Christ. <em>Romans</em> 9. All election that can
be found in the scriptures is according to the flesh, and pertaining to
the Priesthood.
</p>
<p>THE THREE PERSONAGES.&mdash;Everlasting covenant was made between three
personages before the organization of this earth, and relates to their
dispensation of things to men on the earth: these personages, according
to Abraham's record, are called God the first, the Creator; God the
second, the Redeemer; and God the third, the witness or Testator."
</p>
<p>LEHI'S TRAVELS.&mdash;<em>Revelation to Joseph the Seer</em>. The course that
Lehi and his company traveled from Jerusalem to the place of their
destination:
</p>
<p>They traveled nearly a south, southeast direction until they came to
the nineteenth degree of north latitude; then, nearly east to the Sea
of Arabia, then sailed in a southeast direction, and landed on the
continent of South America, in Chili, thirty degrees south latitude.
</p>


<a name="Chronology"></a><h2>BOOK OF MORMON CHRONOLOGY.
</h2>
<p>The events marked are those about which the record does not appear
sufficiently explicit to make the year certain. It is occasionally
difficult to decide whether the circumstance narrated took place near
the close of one year, or in the commencement of the next.
</p>
<p>The four dates marked thus ** are based upon the supposition that
Zeniff re-occupied the land of Nephi, B. C. 200. This may not be the
exact year, but it is approximate.
</p>
<p>The three dates marked thus * are based upon the idea that the "young
man," Alma, was twenty-five years old when the prophet Abinadi was
martyred.
</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon appears to furnish no clue to the date of Lehi's
colony landing in South America. It is supposed to have been about
twelve years after its departure from Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>B. C. signifies before the birth of Christ; A. C. after Christ; N. A.

Jerusalem; Y. J., years of the Judges, or of the Republic.

<a name="temples"></a><h2>TEMPLES AND SACRED PLACES.
</h2>
<p>When the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, determined to make that
people a nation to himself, as soon as they had arrived at a safe
distance from surrounding peoples, he required them to build a
Tabernacle, which is sometimes called the Temple, wherein he could
institute certain ordinances and regulations for their guidance and
worship.
</p>
<p>This, at the commencement of their pilgrimage in the wilderness, was
made portable, and of the costliest and best material within their
reach, and one of the tribes was set apart to have charge of it and its
appurtenances. Such has ever been the purpose of the Lord. This served
them through their journey and in the promised Canaan, until suitable
wealth enabled Solomon to erect a magnificent Temple on Mount Moriah,
since called "The Hill of Zion," to which all Israel came annually to
worship or attend Conference.
</p>
<p>The Lord has informed us <em>Doc. &amp; Cov</em>., <em>Sec</em>. 124, <em>v</em>. 39, that his
people are always commanded to build Temples, or holy houses, unto his
holy name. This accounts for our reading in the Book of Mormon of so
many Temples having been erected on this continent. It also explains
why the Prophet Joseph so early taught the commencement of a Temple in
every important location of the Saints.
</p>
<p>Not less than eight Temples have been designated, and their sites
consecrated, of which there have been dedicated and ordinances
administered therein&mdash;one at Kirtland, Ohio; Nauvoo, Illinois; St.
George, and Logan, Utah. Those at Salt Lake City and Manti are
progressing satisfactorily, the latter nearing completion. The places
appointed in Independence and Far West are in the hands of our
persecutors, who have driven the Saints from their homes, and from the
State.
</p>
<p>The site for a Temple at Independence was dedicated Aug. 3, 1831. Those
present were Joseph Smith, Jr., Sidney Rigdon, Edward Partridge, Wm.
W. Phelps, Oliver Cowdery, Martin Harris, Joseph Coe and Newel Knight.
Description of Temple and city plot in History of Joseph Smith, under
date of June 23 and 24, 1883. This was the first ground dedicated for a
Temple in this dispensation.
</p>
<p>The Temple at Kirtland was 55x65 feet; the corner stones were laid July
23, 1833. Reynolds Cahoon and Jared Carter were building committee.
This was accomplished by donation and voluntary contribution; was
completed and dedicated March 27, 1836.
</p>
<p>The corner stone for a Temple at Far West was laid July 4, 1838, with
appropriate ceremony. Dimensions of building to be 110 feet long and
80 feet wide. Particulars given in the History of Joseph Smith under
this date. Work was re-commenced on this foundation April 26, 1839, and
abandoned for the time on account of exterminating order of Governor
Boggs, expelling the Saints from the State. Apostles Wilford Woodruff
and George A. Smith were ordained on the corner stone of this building,
and took leave of the Saints for a foreign mission, with the other
Apostles who were present, at that time.
</p>
<p>The Temple at Nauvoo, Illinois, was about 128 feet long by 88 feet
wide. The corner stones were laid in the presence of the Nauvoo Legion,
by the various authorities of the Priesthood, on the 6th day of April,
1841. The history of this date gives details of the proceedings.
The building was erected by the tithing and freewill offerings of
the people, and was so rapidly advanced that on the 8th of November
of the same year the Baptismal Font was dedicated, and baptisms for
the dead were administered. The cap stone was laid May 24, 1845. The
upper rooms were dedicated Sunday, December 7, 1845, and sacrament was
administered. Endowments were commenced on the 10th inst. The lower
part of the building was dedicated with public services on Saturday and
Sunday, the 2d and 3d of May, 1846.
</p>
<p>The Salt Lake City site was consecrated and the ground broken for the
foundation Feb. 14, 1853. The corner stones were laid April 6, 1853. It
is 186 1/2 feet by 99 feet in length and width, and is constructed of
hard granite rock, brought from the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon,
a distance of about twenty miles. With ordinary prosperity, its walls
will be up to the square by the Autumn of 1883. We will not undertake a
description of the harmony of its parts, the beauty or grandeur of its
appearance, but refer our readers to the Deseret News of Aug. 17, 1854,
and the Millennial Star, Vol. 16, page 753, for a full description
given by its architect, Truman O. Angell.
</p>
<p>The Temple at St. George, the site of which was dedicated by prayer
by President George A. Smith, and ground broken November 9, 1871, is
141 feet 8 inches by 93 feet 4 inches; 84 feet from ground to top
of parapet. The basement is of volcanic rock, the upper part of red
sandstone, and contains about 1900 cords of rock, and 1,000,000 feet of
lumber, and cost about $800,000.
</p>
<p>The first foundation rock was laid March 10, 1873. On the first of
April following, a deposit of records was made by President Brigham
Young. On the first day of January, 1877, the Font, lower story and
first main floor were dedicated by President Wilford Woodruff, and
April 6, following, a general Conference of all the authorities of the
Church consummated its consecration, at which Counselor Daniel H. Wells
offered the dedication prayer.
</p>
<p>The Manti Temple site was dedicated and the ground broken by President
Brigham Young April 25, 1877. The corner stones were laid April 14,
1879. Its size is 172x95 feet, and 82 feet to square. Its Eastern Tower
is to be 179 feet high; the Western Tower 169 feet high. This edifice
stand on a hill, which required 2400 cords of rock terrace to provide
for its location.
</p>
<p>The site of the Logan Temple is situated on an elevation of table land
in the eastern part of the city bearing that name. It was dedicated
with prayer offered by Apostle Orson Pratt, May 18, 1877, and the
ground was broken the same day. Instructions were given by Presidents
Brigham Young and John Taylor. The corner stones were laid September
17, 1877. The building, including tower and buttresses, is 171 feet
long by 95 in width, with a tower 28 feet square at each end, the
Eastern tower is 156 feet, and the Western tower 151 feet in height,
and 87 feet from the surface to top of battlements. It was dedicated
May 17, 1884, President John Taylor offering the dedicatory prayer.
</p>
<p>The location of the Temple sites at Independence, Kirtland, Far West
and Nauvoo were determined and consecrated by or under direction of the
Prophet Joseph Smith, who also directed the designs and construction of
the Kirtland and Nauvoo Temples.
</p>
<p>The locations of the Temples at Salt Lake City, at St. George, at Manti
and at Logan were determined and dedicated by President Brigham Young,
or by his direction. He also directed the designs of the Salt Lake City
and St. George Temples, and presided at the dedication services of the
latter house.

<h2>GEMS FROM THE HISTORY OF JOSEPH SMITH.
</h2>
<p>HOW THE BOOK OF MORMON WAS OBTAINED.&mdash;<em>May</em> 8, 1838. Joseph Smith's
answer to the question, "How and where did you obtain the Book of
Mormon?" "Moroni, who deposited the plates (from whence the Book of
Mormon was translated,) in a hill in Manchester, Ontario County, New
York, being dead and raised again therefrom, appeared unto me, and
told me where they were, and gave me directions how to obtain them.
I obtained them, and the Urim and Thummim with them, by the means of
which I translated the plates; and thus came the Book of Mormon."
</p>
<p>PLURALITY OF WIVES.&mdash;<em>October</em> 5, 1843. "Gave instructions to try those
persons who were preaching, teaching, or practising the doctrine of
plurality of wives; for, according to the law, I hold the keys of this
power in the last days; for there is never but one on earth at a time
on whom the power and its keys are conferred; and I have constantly
said no man shall have but one wife at a time, unless the Lord directs
otherwise."
</p>
<p><em>October</em> 8, 1843. THE ORGANIZATION OF THE SPIRITUAL AND HEAVENLY
WORLDS, and of spiritual and heavenly beings, was agreeable to the
most perfect order and harmony; their limits and bounds were fixed
irrevocably, and voluntarily subscribed to in their heavenly estate by
themselves, and were by our first parents subscribed to upon the earth.
Hence the importance of embracing and subscribing to principles of
eternal truth by all men upon the earth that expect eternal life.

<a name="emigration"></a><h2>LATTER-DAY SAINTS' EMIGRATION.
</h2>
<p>The publications of the church show that, commencing with the year
1840 and ending with the year 1883, there have been emigrated from
the European countries to the United States, by the church emigration
agencies, 78,219 souls, who have crossed the sea in 243 sail vessels
and steamships.
</p>
<p>These have come in companies of varied numbers, from a dozen or two at
a time to as many as eight hundred or more, which latter number has
embarked several times on double decked ships.
</p>
<p>We regret our inability to give a tabulated statement of the number of
persons from each country of their nativity. The greater proportions
have been from Great Britain and Scandinavia, while Switzerland,
Germany, Italy, Iceland, Finland, East India, South Africa and other
countries have contributed to make up the number.
</p>
<p>A very remarkable feature in this work of gathering Israel is that of
all these vessels that have gone to sea, no one with a Latter-day Saint
on it has ever gone down. Some have been driven back to Port before
they could get out of the Irish channel, one was dismasted before
reaching New Orleans, but all have yielded up their precious souls and
freight to the ports of their destination.
</p>
<p>The organization, cleanliness and consequent health, peace and safety,
have rendered the Saints' emigration notorious and proverbial among
European shippers and ship captains, many of whom have been heard to
say that a company of Mormon emigrants on their ship they considered
better insurance than the underwriters at Lloyd's could give.
</p>


<a name="bookofmormon"></a><h2>THE BOOK OF MORMON.
</h2>
<p>The Book of Mormon is the name of a record which was engraved upon
plates of gold, about 400 years after the crucifixion of our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ, by a celebrated prophet named Mormon. These plates
were deposited by his son, Moroni, in a stone box, in a hill in the
western part of the State of New York, called by the Nephites, Cumorah.
The language in which this record was made was said by Mormon to be
Reformed Egyptian. On the 22d of September, 1823, Moroni discovered
the stone box which contained these plates, the Urim and Thummim, a
sword and breastplate, to the young Prophet, Joseph Smith, Jr., and
he, by the aid of the Urim and Thummim, translated the record from the
plates into the English language. This is the most ancient, the most
accurate and reliable history of America, its ancient inhabitants and
its antiquities, that is now extant; and has since been translated from
the English into the French, German, Italian, Danish, Swedish, Welsh,
Kanaka, Hindostanee, Dutch and Spanish. It has also been printed and
published in all those languages except Spanish, Hindostanee and Dutch,
and will soon be published in the Spanish also.
